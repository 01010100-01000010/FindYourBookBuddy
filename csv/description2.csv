Will she succeed Will she be fired Will the company fail Lencionis utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.Throughout the story Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best onesoften struggle.

16;4069;5;14873;080701429X;Psychiatrist Viktor Frankls memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps including Auschwitz while his parents brother and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it find meaning in it and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankls theoryknown as logotherapy from the Greek word logos (meaning)holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure as Freud maintained but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.At the time of Frankls death in 1997 Mans Search for Meaning had sold more than 10 million copies in twentyfour languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked readers to name a book that made a difference in your life found Mans Search for Meaning among the ten most influential books in America.;184;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1467136625m4069.jpg;Mans Search for Meaning;nonfiction;...Alla to mualo mou gantzotheke sten eikona tes gunaikas moute phantazomoun me allokosme oxuteta.Ten akousa na mou apantaeieida to khamogelo testen entime kai entharruntike matia tes.Alethine e okhie matia tes etan tora pio photere apo ton elio pou arkhize n anatellei.

This Faustlike and magical story is evidence of Hesses searching philosophy and extraordinary sense of humanity as he tells of the humanization of a middleaged misanthrope.

Although he realizes that Lotte is to marry Albert he is unable to subdue his passion for her and his infatuation torments him to the point of absolute despair. The first great confessional novel The Sorrows of Young Werther draws both on Goethes own unrequited love for Charlotte Buff and on the death of his friend Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem. Goethes sensitive exploration of the mind of a young artist at odds with society and illequipped to cope with life is now considered the first great tragic novel of European literature.;176;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Sorrows of Young Werther;fiction;Thee ton ouranonephtiaxes esu etsi te moira ton anthroponoste na men einai eutukhismenoi para mono prin apoktesoun logike ki aphou te khasoun Dustukheki omos poso zeleuo te skoteine melagkholia soute sugkhuse ton aistheseon mesa sten opoia phthineis Bgaineis gematos elpida exogia na mazepseis louloudia gia te basilissa souto kheimonakai thlibesai pou den briskeis kai den katalabaineis giati de briskeis.

29;51893;5;14873;0140047484;Friedrich Nietzsches most accessible and influential philosophical work misquoted misrepresented brilliantly original and enormously influential Thus Spoke Zarathustra is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale in Penguin Classics. Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman the human embodiment of divinity is his successor. Nietzsches utterance God is dead his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by among others Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority but in an allpowerful life force passionate chaotic and free. Frederich Nietzsche (18441900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker Nietzsches influence on subsequent writers such as George Bernard Shaw D.H. Lawrence Thomas Mann and JeanPaul Sartre was considerable. If you enjoyed Thus Spoke Zarathustra you might like Nietzsches Beyond Good and Evil also available in Penguin Classics. Enigmatic vatic emphatic passionate often breathtakingly insightful his works together make a unique statement in the literature of European ideas A. C.

Rilke was staying at a castle (Duino) on the sea near Trieste. One morning he walked out on the battlements and climbed down to where the rocks dropped sharply to the sea. From out of the wind which was blowing with great force Rilke seemed to hear a voice Wer wenn ich schriee horte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen (If I cried out who would hear me up there among the angelic orders). He wrote these words the opening of the first Duino Elegy in his notebook then went inside to continue what was to be his major work and one of the literary masterpieces of the century.;208;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Duino Elegies;poetry;Makari ki emeis ena kommati ges na briskame anthropino  ena mikrokatharodiateremenomia dike mas spithame  khoma karpophoro anamesa ston potamo kai ston brakho.

In response three young men  the aristocratic Liu Xuande the fugitive Lord Guan and the pigbutcher Zhang Fei  meet to pledge eternal brotherhood and fealty to their beleaguered government.

McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given 25000 in savings to charity abandoned his car and most of his possessions burned all the cash in his wallet and invented a new life for himself. Four months later a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991 McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car stripped it of its license plates and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name Alexander Supertramp and unencumbered by money and belongings he would be free to wallow in the raw unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map McCandless simply threw away the maps.

He tells his tale from the plot of a poor apprentice who seeks higher learning from his master. Because he seeks for riches of knowledge FIRST the master imparts to the man the secrets of how to obtain wealth through discipline and moral conduct. The story rings aloud with truth from start to finish in a palatable format for any reader to truly begin to understand the laws of wealth.

135;1097;4;282957;0060838582;A groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.Are we what we eat To a degree both engrossing and alarming the story of fast food is the story of postwar America. Though created by a handful of mavericks the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape widened the chasm between rich and poor fueled an epidemic of obesity and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad.Thats a lengthy list of charges but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of firstrate reportage wry wit and careful reasoning. Schlossers mythshattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast foods flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold Americas most dangerous job  meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations.Along the way Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating unsettling truths  from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production popular culture and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains efforts to reel in the youngest most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization  a phenomenon launched by fast food. Fast Food Nation is a groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.;399;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Fast Food Nation The Dark Side of the AllAmerican Meal;nonfiction;you are what you eat. this will open your eyes to a few hidden truths about the foods on the market and why people are so sick and overweight.

Anyone who applies the courage to BE who they are without fear of rejection or ridicule finds the key to happiness in this life.;Ralph Waldo Emerson
145;323355;5;282957;0967686563;The Book of Mormon is a volume of scripture comparable to the Bible. It is a record of Gods dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains as does the Bible the fullness of the everlasting gospel.The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words written on gold plates were quoted and abridged by a prophethistorian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C. and afterward separated into two nations known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years all were destroyed except the Lamanites and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians.The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel outlines the plan of salvation and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come.After Mormon completed his writings he delivered the account to his son Moroni who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21 1823 the same Moroni then a glorified resurrected being appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language.In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved.Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of our religion and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other book.In addition to Joseph Smith the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith as The Testimony of Three Witnesses and The Testimony of Eight Witnesses.We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon to ponder in their hearts the message it contains and the to ask God the Eternal Father in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost.

Their comments tend to stem from deep rooted hatred for mormons and it is obvious. It is personal and they have an axe to grind. Most of them probably never even read the book (go ahead ask them a few questions about the storiespeoplecivilizationsmorals inside and they cant answer them becasue they havent read it or didnt undrstand it)  Rather than reviewing it for the message it teaches they bash and rant about why it doesnt fit in with their own dogmatic beliefs or lifestyles.  Even if you are NOT LDS this book offers a WONDERFUL perspective and illustrates the cycle of pride which rotates throughout time over and over again. It teaches pricipals of love faith forgiveness and what happens to ANY nation that allows prideevilcontention to sneak in and rip it apart. The fact is a nation without God at the center of it is doomed to fail... I think any Christian can agree to that.  Ive read it 5 times as of this review. It is my FAVORITE book and I base much of my own writing from its principals. I gain so much strength from its pages and experience improved faith in my creator.  Mormon or not how can a book that teaches about Christ and his ways be bad Even if you never intend to step foot in an LDS church consider this a text to uplift and give you hope. It should be a part of every Christians reading.  So set aside what youve been told by people who try to steer you away from this book and ask yourself this If the adversary was afraid I might come closer to God for reading this book then what lengths would he go to STOP me from ever reading it;Anonymous Joseph Smith Jr.

I normally read fantasy or action scifi so when I came across this book I wasnt sure I was going to like it so much. Actually if it hadnt been for my son (who sparked my interest in the book I may have overlooked it). Im so glad I gave it a crack.  First off if you love British humor youll get a healthy dose of it here Were not talking Monty Python but it ranks right up there with it filled to the brim with gutbusting laughs but has much stronger plotting than skitcomedy. Though I could totally see American actor Ben Stiller playing the role of jixX (if he could pull off a British accent) and John Cleese playing the role of the scientist.  The story starts out with a massive spaceship crash landing near the space port returned home from its mission way too early The politicians space command crew computers and committee members are all a bit on the daft side. jixX (a landscape architect) just happens to be in the wrong place at the right time and is mistakenly chosen to lead the mission back into space to find out what went awry.  Without going into spoilermode jixX is thrust into quite the adventure. His unorthodox crew members seem like a recipe for disaster including a carpenter gynaecologist and scientist trying to prove the existence of God.(I must say never a dull moment aboard this ship). There are many surprises aboard the ship as jixX tries to solve the mystery hes saddled with.  To make matters worse they are confronted with a crazy race of aliens called Benjamites whose belief system revolves around the almighty BRICK. Among the aliens are a group of religious loonies who go on an on about a prophecy concerning the end of the Universe. They believe that the Ultimate Inferior Beings are an absentminded race that are so incompetent that they will bring about the demise of the galaxy through their own stupidity. And that race of idiots would happen to be humans... well at least according to one certain alien who steps up as a selfappointed savior to the universe. In his crazy rants he insists that humankind must be destroyed before they can cause total destruction.  Thus the fate of humanity rests upon jixXs shoulders (as if he didnt already have enough to worry about). Theres even a witty index at the end of the book that first appears to be pointless but ends up having a purpose after all. This book from start to finish kept me laughing out loud.

I still loved it and I can finally write a review to spread my love D Will be coming soon  also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Its no secret that Im a huge fan of Juliet Marillier. Books you love are always the hardest to review. How can I describe the magical writingstyle the great fairytale feeling and the amazing characters in just a few words This is something you have to explore yourself. If someone asks me who my favorite author is Juliet Marillier is definitely a name I would think of. Ive read most of her books and I absolutely adore this one Hearts blood (will reread this one soon) and The seven waters series (which I hope to review once) This is the third time I return to this book and it was again a great experience. That is why I love rereading so much. Its like wrapping yourself in your favorite blanket.  This book is a soft mix of The frog princess and The twelve dancing princesses. Jena lives with her four sisters and father in the middle of a forest called Wildwood. There are rumors about magic and otherworldly creatures. There are whispers about the danger of those creatures but Jenna and her sisters know better. Every full moon they use a portal in their room to cross to the other side where they dance until the morning. What I love is how every sister has her distinct voice like Paula how discusses science with the witches or the young Stella who plays hide and seek with the younger creatures.  When their father leaves to a warm country to regain strength from his sickness Jena is in charge. She has always been the responsible one and she has taken over the role of mother after she died. Jena has one best friend her frog Goku. He talks to her in her head and their friendship is so cute. Despite the fact that he is a frog they care for each other and he is always there to help her. But their cousin Cezar finds it irresponsible to leave a girl in charge. Women are meant to take care of the children and nothing more. Jena tries to stand up against him but its no use. He slowly takes over their household and his hatred for the otherworldly creatures is blinding him. The girls are in a difficult position now especially when Tati (the eldest sister) falls in love with a Nightwalker. Its not safe to cross to the other world now and Jena must end this otherwise Tati might die from sadness.  Every sister has a distinct voice. There is Paula the intelligent one who loves to talk to the witches and wizards about science and the youngest sister Stella who loves to play hide and seek with her mystical friends. We get to know them and I like them all for their own aspects but this book is mainly about Jena a girl with a huge heart and much courage. She is somethings too strong for her own good but I love how she does everything with good intentions. Its not easy for her to stand up against Cezar  especially when he is starting to show certain affections for her.  The use of the fairytales is subtle and I like how she created a story of her own. Its not too obvious that its based on another tale and I adore her worldbuilding. If youve never experience Marilliers writingstyle before I highly suggest you do. Its flowing descriptive just pure magic. I hope I did justice to this book.;Juliet Marillier

175;24128;3;236117;0743477561;The Merchant of Venice is one of Shakespeares most popular comedies but it remains deeply controversial. The text may seem antiSemitic yet repeatedly in performance it has revealed a contrasting nature. Shylock though vanquished in the lawcourt often triumphs in the theatre. In his intensity he can dominate the play challenging abrasively its romantic and lyrical affirmations. What results is a bittersweet drama.Though The Merchant of Venice offers some of the traditional pleasures of romantic comedy it also exposes the operations of prejudice.

My book club friends were raving about the books though so when I saw they had the series at my library I decided to go for it.  I thought it was a very enjoyable story but to be very honest I wasnt blown away by it. The writingstyle feels a bit young so I would definitely count this one as a mix between MGYA. I like that its written from the POV of a boy and Rick does a great job in writing the voice of a young boy. I was also surprised how much I liked Annabeth. She was a little bitchy in the movie but she was much kinder in the book. I couldnt stop myself from comparison this trio with Harry Potter which was fun.  Its definitely an improvement in comparison with the movie and I have the next book waiting for me so lets see what more this series has to offer.;Rick Riordan

Women are stripped from every right but one some are used to make children to repopulate the world. This is all based on the idea that it is best for them. There are different titles you can have like Aunt Marthas (Commander) Wifes Handmaids or Unwoman.  The book follows Handmaid Offred and her life in the household of Serena Joy although women dont hold their previous names anymore. There are different flashbacks at random moments to her life before how she loved Luke and their daughter. How she was taught this new way of living. We see how she makes the wrong choices and the end is open for your own interpretation.  I have to say that the writing itself really bothered me. It was long boring and full of descriptions that made me lose track of what the author was trying to say. The flashbacks were also hard to follow at times because sometimes I didnt realize it was a flashback at first. The plot itself is scary and too relevant for all the things that are going on right now.

This is a love story with bite.;498;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1361039443m41865.jpg;Twilight (Twilight 1);fantasy paranormal;First I want to say that I dont understand the connection between Twilight and Harry Potter. Why the hell do people compare these books They have nothing in common. Oh yeah they are both fantasy but thats it (And not to mention that Harry Potter is much better.)  This book tells the story of the whining Bella. She moves to Forks to live with her dad. At school she is getting obsessed with Edward. Dont know why but she annoys me so much at this point. Ohhh I dont want to go to biology because Edward looks mad at me boehoe. Please girl get a life (I think that his role in her life is too big. Her whole life begins to spin around him and thats not healthy. And on every page she must tell everything about his gorgeous eyes his pretty smile or his perfect body. It gets boring.)  Then she finds out that Edward is a vampire. The trouble begins cause now its an endless story about go away youre safer if youre not with me and I want you because youre the love of my life. And I laughed SO hard when Edward started to sparkle in the sun. Really couldnt stop laughing ) If you need a reason to keep your vampires out of the sun please try to think about sometime more.. dangerous. If someone begins to sparkle nobody will be scared  But Bella is so in love with Edward that she decides to look past his dangerous vampire life. He and his family live on animal blood so thats no problem. But the vampires that are visiting her town are a problem and they begin to hunt Bella down. In the end everything ends happily ever after.  Sure I know that I sound a bit.. critical but overall I found the book okay. Bella is a bit too clumsy dull and she complains too much but I liked her more in the book than in the movie. She has more humor.  I found Alice very nice ) And Jacob is cute Hes so insecure and shy lovely D Yeah despite the whole I love you youre my life and I cant live with you it was a nice book to read ) Not the best Ive ever read but also not so worse that I couldnt finish it. And I still want to read the rest of this serie.  Still some thing I want to mention  If someone sneeks into your room to watch you sleep thats not romantic Thats super scary and freaky especially if you dont know eachother.  I dont get the whole Edwardhype because honestly he doesnt sound attractive to me at all. Too perfect too smooth too much of everything.  The storyline is actually quite small. Girl meets vampire they fall in love a little bit of action and a lot more love.  You dont have to claim your boyfriend. You can have a normal life and a relationship. And its good to have goals in your life not only be with Edward.  So I think that Ive said everything I wanted to say about this book. I hope that the next one is better );Stephenie Meyer

I thought I was going to love this book and when I saw all the high ratings I was excited.  But this was not what I expected (  Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  The only reason why I managed to read this book was because of the shortness of the stories. I kept hoping that one of them was good but I was disappointed by all. The first story is by far the best one. Its a retelling of Snow White and its the only one with a fairytale feeling. There is still something strange going on because her mothers new husband is the one who awakes her with a kiss..  The one from Beauty and the Beast wasnt that bad either (otherwise I would have been very sad). Beauty is starting to turn into a beast and when he is starting to change into a human she is a bit disappointed. That was a fun twist.  All the others were strange and not what I expected. There are several stories about rape there is one with a drug addiction not really stories you would expect in a fairytale retelling. Its so harsh and realistic. I want magic faeries romance  hell I even want instantlove. There is no fun in a retelling where Sleeping Beauty is made addicted to opium and where she is used by several men at the same time for pornographic photos. That is just wrong in my eyes and it doesnt do justice to the real story.  Another thing that also bothered me was the fact that there are no quotation marks. Its very confusing and I was sometimes lost in the conversations. The only positive thing I can think of is that I like the cover. Its a shame that it doesnt match the inside. The high ratings on Goodreads are a mystery to me.. And I dont think I will be reading anything from this author soon.;Francesca Lia Block

She is so down but thats what you get when you dont have a social life. If youre life only depends on Edward..  The thing I liked about Edward leaving is that youve get to know Jacob better. I liked him. Hes so much better than Edward eventhough hes just as flawless. Hes just as perfect. He can decide when he wants to turn into a werewolf so hes not doomed to be one every full moon. He doesnt kill the people he love because hes a rational werewolf.. Ehmm Thats just as crazy as a sparkling vampire  However I honestly hoped that Bella would give Jacob a chance. Hes madly in love with her (what the hell is wrong with all those guys Shes more lovers than any other girl in books and shes definately not the most attractive girl Ive ever read about).  When Bella jumps of a cliff Edward thinks she died so he wants to join her in death (how romantic ahem) He decides to go to Italie where hell be ripped apart by a very powerful vampirefamily.

(The families arent exactly very nice.)  Then their grandmother  who was dead according to their father  wants them to live with her. Daphne is so happy but Sabrina doesnt trust it. She thinks its just a lunatic an old lady who lost her mind. She keeps talking to the house and empty rooms. She has strange foods and she has very strange thoughts shes a detective and she hunts for a giant.  But then comes the most unexpected thing for Sabrina. Her grandmother is kidnapped by the giant and with the help of several fairytale characters she must save her. Daphne always believed her grandmother so she made me laugh a couple of times. Shes the young sister but shes not young when she makes Sabrina feel guilty about her suspision behavoir.  I really liked this story eventhough its meant for children around the age of 9  11. It wasnt very childish and I found Daphne a very nice character ) I also liked the fact that we get to meet so many fairytale characters like the three pigs and the big bad wolf (who is in real person not so big and bad).;Michael Buckley Peter Ferguson

This was by far my favorite book from the series (so far I havent read Forest Born yet) and I think its because its based on a fairy tale. Ani  short for Anidori  is send away to a foreign country to get married to the prince. Her mother arranged everything to get more ties with Bayern. Ani grew up under her aunts guidance and thats how she learned to speak with animals a skill that isnt appreciated by most. When she is on her way to Bayern Ani is betrayed by her ladyinwaiting and she managed to escape. She takes the job of goose girl for the King until she finds a way to tell the truth.  Ani was a strong character. I liked how she embraces being different and how she uses her gifts. She becomes a goose girl without whining or feeling sorry for herself. Better she starts to enjoy her new life and the freedom it gives her. There are no twists or unexpected turns but thats not what this story needs. It was magical.;Shannon Hale

Left by her real father and mother in an Inn Aza grew up in a loving family. They always believed that she was special even when she isnt that pretty. Because sometimes beauty comes from within and Aza has a wonderful heart.She also has a special talent. She can make different voices and let them come from other objects. Illusing. When she goes to the Royal wedding from the King and his new Queen her talent is discovered. The Queen  Ivy  wants to use her voice as her own since her voice isnt as pretty as she looks. Aza cant decline because Ivy uses evil methods. She is stuck but her developing friendship with the prince makes everything much better.Can Aza escape from the Queen  Opinion.  First of all I could identify with Aza. A huge period of my life I felt ugly and I never believed anyone could fall in love with me. I felt so sorry for her and the fact that she couldnt see how special she was. Everybody  except her family and the prince  treated her so badly I hate the fact that appearance are so important. I was so glad that she discovered that beauty is more than just a pretty face  and that she is beautiful in her own way.  Second this book is loosely based on Snow white and I love the originality. Instead of dwarves she gets Gnomes and she even got locked up in the famous mirror. Snow White isnt my favorite princess but Aza captured my heart. She totally deserved her prince. Their love developed  no instant love after a kiss.  The only thing that bothered me was the singing. I liked it when they performed but they also sing random lines in a conversation. Can you imagine that That you are talking to your best friend and suddenly they break out into singing It was.. too strange for me.If you are looking for a different spin with a lovely heroin definitely take a look at this book;Gail Carson Levine

I was glad to see that she wasnt such a whiner and I liked her conversations with Jace. The story was nice. I liked the idea of Shadowhunters in our world and the use of all the creatures like werewolves and demons. There was a steady pace action and a bit of romance. The plot was welldone and I was baffled by the ending. You could say that I did not see THAT coming. At all.

Her writingstyle manages to capture the essence of a fairytale a magical feeling with great characters romance some action and a happilyeverafter.  What I appreciated was the fact that there are stories in this story. Shahrazad is a storyteller and to save the king from his cold heart she tells a story. After a painful betrayal the King planned to marry a maiden once a month for only one night. He was planning to have Sharazad killed after their night but he is captured by the story and night after night she waves a tale. That is until a treacherous plot tries to ruin Shahrazad plan. Is she able to sees the Kings heart before it is too late and will he see hers  One thing that bothered me were the difficult similar names. We have Shahrazad but also Shahrayar and his brother Sharazam. I think Dokey tried to capture the Arabian feeling but I had a hard time to get to know them. I had to reread sentences now and then to truly understand who was talking. Besides that I really liked Shahrazad and Shahrayar. The kings plan is ridiculous but I can understand that his heart was shattered. Its great that blind Shahrazad looks at him with other eyes and their romance has time to develop.  Its always nice when there is no instalove but an instaconnection which deepens when nights pass.If you are looking for a quick and fun fairytale this is the one you want to pick up.;Cameron Dokey

Half way I started to skim the pages. This book just doesnt work for me.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I must admit that I wasnt very excited to read this book in the first place. My first book from this author was The rose bride and I gave it two stars in the end. My main problem with that book also happened here in Spirited I was bored. The story seemed to go on and on. I also wasnt invested in the shallow plot or the annoying characters.  I actually started to skim most of the pages towards the ending and that is a bad sign for such a short book. It just didnt work for me and it irked me. The beast in this story is a beast because he is a Native American. I didnt like that. The way Isabella portrays him was annoying and the beastly features in the real story is what makes this so magical. Wusamequin is a healthy goodlooking guy so the whole true nature of the story fell flat to me. Isabelle isnt Belle worthy. Where I absolutely love the original Belle Isabelle annoyed the heck out of me. She is whiny arrogant and stupid. The way she thinks about these people as less because they have never been into a house.. And she keeps saying Mahwah and its pathetic when you find out what that word means.  There is also something off about the writingstyle. Its overly descriptive in the beginning and that made the story drag. Add the unlikable characters and Im done.

I finally started this series for two reasons. Judith recommended this series a couple of times and we might go and watch the movie with our bookclub. While this isnt the best book Ive ever read I thought it was very enjoyable.  I liked how the world was build. There was enough information to understand the hierarchy without having an information dump. There are bad vampires Strigoi good vampires Moroi and the ones in between halfhuman halfvampire also Dhampirs. They are the sworn protectors (or Guardians) from the Moroi vampires. Rose and Lissa have something that is even more special because they are connected. Rose is a Dhamphir and can feel Lissas feelings. Sometimes shes sucked into Lissas head and this strong bond makes Rose the ideal protector. The girls ran away but are brought back to St. Vladimirs Academy after two years of freedom by Dimitri. He is now also Lissas protector and he gives Rose extra lessons to make up for her lost school time.But things arent as good as they might seem. Rose and Lissa have to suffer from horrible rumors and Lissa keeps finding dead animals in her room. Something strange is going on and when Rose starts to unravel more information about Lissas gifts she starts to worry for her friends sanity. Until Lissa disappears.  I had some trouble with Rose. She is many things we all wish we could be. Strong smart kickass and loyal but on the downside she is sometimes a bit too arrogant too stubborn and unsteady. Its good to have a character that is comfortable with her looks but she went over the top here and there  I knew perfectly well that there werent a lot of girls at this school who looked as good in a bra as I did.  I dont think its very admirable when a character believes she is so much better than any other girl. She always points out how she is curvy and the vampire girls arent but that doesnt make her any prettier. Her sarcasm is great though and I adored her friendship with Lissa. Its clear that they are meant for each other. Lissa is unpredictable. She is described as someone who looks like a princess but she is mentally unstable and always on the brink of depression. I liked her and I think that with the right guidance Lissa can be a strong and good leader with many loyal followers.  Unraveling what was going on with the dead animals wasnt too hard but you know what Thats not what I was expecting about this book. Its easy fluffy and funny  sometimes thats all what Im asking for. I honestly dont care about the romance at this stage. The age difference between Rose and Dimitri is something I cant overlook for now but I do want more.;Richelle Mead

The stories are loosely based on the fairytales we know and I always like the twist she gives them. Unfortunately I wasnt so enthusiastic about this one. I must admit the fairytale about the magic flute is new to me. Never heard of it before but in this book there is hardly any flute. We hear a lot about a boy who can play with bells  and they are magical because they can play the sound of someones heart. He uses them to summon the boy of Minas heart.  A home is a place ones heart creates and so recognizes as its own.  I liked the idea but I never connected to the characters in the book. Its not that Mina is a terrible main character but I also disliked her in some way. The characters felt a bit too flat for me. So if you are planning to read a book from Dokey  and you should do that because her other books are great  dont start with this one );Cameron Dokey

Those who do not know how to see the precious things in life will never be happy.  Kyle has everything at first sight he has a rich father he is handsome he is popular and he is doing fine in school but he is mean against people who are less in his eyes. The people who arent incredibly pretty who arent popular and who study hard for their grades. Like the real Beauty and the beast story Kyle is spoiled and unkind.Kendra arrives at his school and he immediately thinks she is a freak. He finds her ugly and strange so it should be fun to make a joke out of her right With that action he seals his faith. Kendra puts a spell on him and he takes the appearance of a beast. He has two years to change to fall in love and let someone fall in love with him.You are ugly now on the inside where it matters most...you are beastly.  Kyle undergoes a huge transformation. He finds out that his life wasnt as perfect as he thought and he understand his nasty behavior. When Lindy comes crashing into his life will he be able to make her fall in love with him before it is too late  Opinion.  People make such a big deal about looks but after a while when you know someone you dont even notice anymore... I love the concept of this story that is why Beauty and the beast is my favorite tale. We all judge people based on their appearance even if we dont want to. I really started to like Kyle. He changes and I loved to see his development throughout the story. Its written from his POV so that is greatLindy is lovely. She is a huge fan of reading and she has a hard life. Despite all she never gave up and she does everything to pursue her dreams. She has a nice personality and I thought they were perfect for each other.  The only critic I have is that Lindy feels a bit distant. The other side characters are a great addition to the story like his blind tutor Will.If you are a fan of fairytales you will love this one.

The chemistry between Ella and Charles is much better on screen than in the book  and they made the story much more fastpaced.

It sucked me in from the beginning and it blew me away with some of its wisdom and word choices. The author made it really easy to connect with the young boy David which is not an easy task. There was not a moment where I felt the voice was too young or too old it was simply perfect.  The subtle use of the fairytales and how they are not the perfect happilyeverafter characters the emotions throughout the story the character development I loved it all. David misses his mother and he has a hard time accepting the fact that his father has a new woman in his life and that he has a little brother. His behaviour felt realistic and I liked the aspect of his family and how he slowly starts to accept his new life.  Gah this is one of those books I want to reread very soon.;John Connolly

William is a noble with a hot temper and a bad name and he makes her shiver.

And the story is actually building towards.. nothing. We already know the identity of the wolf in the beginning of the book and I actually dont see the point of this story.. Such a shame because Red Riding Hood is a great story.  also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com    Oh man this was disappointing. Red Riding Hood is a great concept but Viguie didnt do this tale any justice. The story has no real point it seemed so useless. We know the identity of the wolf from the beginning (its already told in the blurb) and the ending is so lame  Ruth is bitten by a wolf when she was little. She is now scared all the time but she is still going IN THE DARK to her grandmother who was living deep in the forest. When you are so afraid of the big bad wolf why the hell do you go to your grandmother in the middle of the night Ruth works together with her father as blacksmith after her brother left for the Holy War in Jerusalem. I can see that her life is pretty busy but I think her father would give her some free time to visit Granny.  In an attempt to make the story a little bit interesting  a failed attempt mind you  William enters the story. He has a bad name and he is plagued by a curse. Yep. Mystery solved. He is immediately crazy about Ruth and he cant stop thinking about her. When the two of them spent SOME time together he proposes to her and of course she says yes After this there is some Im too dangerous for you please stay with me no you should go drama. In the end she gets her father approval  huh what He doesnt even know him only his bad reputation. I also need to point out that the love is creepy.  1. He attacked Ruth when she was little. Not very attractive to me.  2. He knows that he is dangerous for Ruth but he cant live without her. That is no love that is being selfish and egoistic.  3. He watches her when she sleeps before they really know each other. HA kidding but it wouldnt surprised me if he did.  Ruths cousin Peter returned from the war and he has some serious issues. I was hoping to get something exciting out of this but he constantly says that he doesnt want to talk about it So what is the use of being mysterious when you dont want to reveal it in the end of the story It felt like a poor excuse for his attack on Ruths grandmother. He is forcing the old woman to teach him her magic but she denies it. This makes the ending even more lame. The curse is cured with the blink of an eye and I just had to roll my eyes. It was a very pathetic attempt of a happilyeverafter.  The only reason this book got 1.5 flowers instead of 1 Ruth is a blacksmith despite everyones disapproval. She stands up for herself and she even starts a fight with a man because he insults her  and she was winning. But the disconnection from all the characters the fact that the story builds towards nothing and the horrible ending make me recommend to you please dont read this book.;Debbie Viguie

His adoptive mother sends him away because she is afraid he might turn to his fathers side. When the Inquisitor from the Clave comes for him he is locked away in the dungeons in the City of Bones. Valentine slays the brothers and takes another Mortal Instrument with him the Sword. He tries to persuade Jace to join him and his quest.There are also strange killings going on. Someone is slaying the Downworlders. When Simon and one of Lukes werewolves are taken away its obvious who took them. Valentine has a master plan he wants to raise an army of demons to attack the Clave. Can they stop him before it is too late  Opinion.  Im still not satisfied with the whole ClaryJacebrothersisterthing. It actually made me feel a bit disgusted. So I better be right about themThere is a lot going on in this book. (Clary and Simon are in some sort of relationship Downworlders are dying her mother doesnt wake up Valentine is trying to manipulate Jace and Jace has to deal with the Inquisitor.) Despite that the story was easy to follow and I liked the constant pace. The plot was good and the ending left me excited for the next book. There were some things that bothered me.  Clary.. I like her but I expected her to finally kick some butt. She is a Shadowhunter in name but not in action. She recently found out that she has a gift for Runes but that is hardly explained. I hope that we will get more background about it. The same for Jace newfound talent.  Quote  Ive got a stele we can use. Who wants to do me  A regrettable choice of words muttered Magnus.  One major complain I have is a spoiler SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER.When Valentine sliced Simons throat and drained him from his blood I expected him to die. It would be much more believable.

Ahhh Razo. Another character we saw in the first two books. He has something naughty about him. He reminded me a little of Puck from The Iron Fey series. I liked his development. In the beginning he is very innocent and not aware of his own potential. It was good to see how he grows and realize he has things to offer. I also liked that this story took part in another setting Tiran. He is there to make sure that there wont be another war but its hard when there are many people who want to kill you to sabotage the peace.  I cant wait to read Forest born;Shannon Hale

This book is what I would call a classic good High fantasy. It has a lot of aspects I look for in a fantasy magical powers interesting plot and fun characters. And you might know me by now and my antipathy for most romances but I adored this one  I loved all the different Graces and how people use them in their normal life. Being a Graceling means being feared and almost shunned by others especially Katsa. For her Grace is deadly and she is used by her uncle to spread fear and obedience. It was fun seeing her grow into her Grace.  Katsa is a wonderful character. She is incredibly strong and intelligent but what I loved about her was the fact that she shows her vulnerable soft side. It made her realistic and it shows that she isnt perfect. I always appreciate complexity in characters. The fact that she starts a Rebellion against her uncle made me admire her and her courage. Her banters with Po were adorable.  Po comes very close to being too perfect. He has a special Grace he must hide from everyone and he is the only one who comes close to Katsas fighting level. I still liked him and I shipped them together like crazy. There was something between them that spark I look for in romance. Not only that there is enough time to make it believable for me. When Katsa finally stand up against her uncle she flees together with Po on an important mission. Pos grandfather was kidnapped by one of the neighbor kingdoms and they must find out who and why They develop a friendship on their journey and it brings them in a dangerous situation. This was an interesting plot and I liked the villain.  Were also introduced to some other characters. Not all of them are completely fleshed out but I feel like I know enough of them to make them standout as individuals. I especially liked the young Bitterblue who complicates the case with her appearance. Im definitely intrigued to find out more about Bitterblue. Cashore showed me that she knows how to write. An easy writingstyle an engaging plot and a solid worldbuilding I cant ask for more.;Kristin Cashore

Review coming soon.  3.5 stars.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  The first thing I noticed was the fact that Magic study lacked of something. Something Poison study did manage to capture. Perhaps its the fact that Valek is hardly there or the bitunrealistic situations our MC has to endure. Everything went a bit TOO good and our MC had quite some luck when her somewhat annoying temper came up. But nonetheless a good book that makes me look forward to part three.  Summary.  Yelena is reunited with her family. Her parents are happy but her brother eyes her with suspicion. He believes she is a spy for Ixia and when he takes her to their capitol he betrays her. Yelena is taken to a man who claims to be heir to the throne he is the nephew of the slayed king. She can prove her innocence and she is taken into some school. She is under protection of the fourth Magician Irys and soon it becomes clear that she has a very dangerous and strong power. Its not just her ability to talk to animals or to control minds she is a Soulfinder. Someone who can bring the dead back.  This power is used to help them find a rogue magician. He is raping and killing girls so he can collect their souls and grow in strength. Then there is also the matter with the Commandant. He comes from Ixia to talk to the people of Sitia. Valek is hidden behind magic with the delegation. Yelena is more than happy to see him but it is dangerous. People of Sitia hate him and they want him dead including the Kings nephew.  Review.  Let me get started with the positive things.  This story is plotwise strong. I liked where it was going to and how it unraveled in the end. Valek and Yelena both made many enemies and that gives some good action. Marias writingstyle is pleasant and it makes this a quick read. I really liked Valek and some of the new introduced characters.  This brings me to some things I thought that lacked of something. First of all Yelena. Its not that I disliked her but she lost some of the charm she had in Poison study. She throws herself head over heal in dangerous situations with a letsseehowthisworksout attitude. The thing is everything ends well. She is hardly injured and her powerful magic  she recently discovered  is always there to help her. I wish she was less careless and took more time to think about it. Everybody is trying to help her but she is stubborn and a bit of a knowitall. Its not bad when MCs think for themselves but it was too reckless. It also made the action less exciting because I already knew that nothing bad was going to happen there was no tension. Most of the times I was like  Second the fact that its cliched. MC suddenly becomes one of the most powerful magicians having the gift of Soulfinder that hardly exist. She doesnt need much training because everything just seem to come from within. Neh didnt buy it. It would have been much more realistic if she had to train and made mistakes when she uses her magic.  I still have high hopes that book three has the spark from Poison study.;Maria V. Snyder

I reread this book because I bought the third and last book about a week ago. I want to refresh my memory. I still loved it maybe even more than the first time There is so much tension and action in this book but we also get to meet romance and friendship.  Short version  Mary has to leave the safety of her village and is plunged into a world filled with Unconsecrated. She has to leave The forest of hands and teeth. Is there somewhere a place to start a new life  I just LOVE this book. If you havent read it go and do it What are you waiting for This book has everything you possibly can ask for. Mary is a wonderful character and the story never gets boring. There are so many things going on without overwhelming you. The ending is perfect everything seems to fall together but you still want to read the next one. Finding out how this story will continue.  Spoilerish version  One of those days when you cant understand why there is such a beauty in a world that is nothing but ugly.  Mary lives with her mother and brother Jed in a village surrounded by The forest of hands and teeth. Her father disappeared and everybody knows his fate he is an Unconsecrated now a zombie. Her mother keeps believing that he is alive and her days are filled with staring at the forest.  Mary has a best friend Cassie and the two brothers Harry and Travis. She is in love with Travis but Harry has his eyes on her. When her mother is infected Mary gives her the choice become an Unconsecrated or die. Her mother wants to be together with her father so she wants to become an Unconsecrated. Her brother is so mad at Mary that he throws her out of the house and she must become a Sister.  The Sisterhood is the leader of the village followed by The Guardians. Its not something Mary wants to become. It means that she must give up asking questions and she is filled with them. Are the stories her mother told her true She longs to see the ocean and the cities with buildings high in the sky. Is there a world outside  She gets a glimpse of an answer but thats before her world turns into chaos. The fast one destroyed the fence. Unconsecrated are in the city and its too late. Mary Harry Cassie Jed Jacob a dog called Argos Travis and Beth can escape by going into the forest. They find a village but soon there are Unconsecrated everywhere. They manage to stay save for a while but they must flee and Travis gets bitten.  I cant be your secondchoice dream.  They must kill Travis and thats when my heart just broke. There was something sweet between them even when you know that Mary will follow her heart to pursue her dream seeing the ocean. And I really liked Travis he was a nice character. The way he loved Mary and talked to hear. The way he understood her desires and dreams.  Mary knows that she must leave The forest of hands and teeth to an unknown place. A place where only Unconsecrated rule the world according to the Sisterhood. Jed decides to stick with his sister but they run into trouble and Mary loses consciousness. When she wakes up she is on a beach  almost decapitated by a man. Its his job to kill the Mudos. Sometimes they wash up on shore. He takes Mary with him while Jed is gone.  I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this book. It was my first zombie book ever and it made me fall in love with this genre. Mary is a wonderful character. She isnt afraid to believe in her dreams and to follow them. And yes she is selfish but arent we all sometimes Dont we all want the one we love in our life These flaws makes her real a person. You have Travis a real sweetheart with a lot of courage. His dead did something with me. I almost cried. Im glad that Mary finally saw the ocean she longs for. The zombies are terrifying. I liked the description it made them so vivid and scary. Without a doubt a favorite of mine.;Carrie Ryan

Catherine Howard cousin of Anne Boleyn is just another pawn in the Howard family. They are hungry for power and money  and they will sacrifice everyone in order to gain it. Henry VIII is recently married to his fourth wife Anne of Cleves but she isnt as pretty as expected. He divorces and he asks Catherine to be his fifth wife. He is now at the age of fortynine while Catherine is fifteen years old. She is a beauty but she is also naive and young. She must give up her old life which also means her love for Thomas.  Life at court is dangerous. The King has mood swings and Catherine cant get pregnant. When her past comes into her present she must do everything to stay in the good graces of the King. But when the rumours are spread and an old lover starts to talk Catherine starts to fear for her life. So much that she takes matters into her own hands  a decision that makes things even worse.  Opinion.  I know a lot about Anne of Boleyn one of the most famous Queens from Henry VIII but I didnt know much about Catherine Howard. Based on her character in television show The Tudors I expected her to be annoying but I liked her voice. She is still very young so she doesnt see that they use her as a poppet. I found her story incredibly sad. She will do anything to keep the King happy but that also means that she cant follow her heart.  This story also shows how dangerous Henry is. He gives his love easily but he takes it away in a whim. When Catherine is locked in the Towers she sees the ghost from Anne Boleyn. I liked how those two stories entwined.  I recommend this book to lovers from The Tudors. It gives a good insight in the short life from Catherine as Queen. While nothing really happens I was never bored by her voice. Its rich and detailed. She handled her forced status as Queen in a great way for a fifteen year old girl and my heart ached for her.  I do not know what has happened but from what I just saw of Henry I can imagine what is true he has discovered a thorn on his rose. I have shattered the heart of the King of England. God knows what will become of me now.;Alisa M. Libby

It is the story of two women their guardian angels and a mysterious subversive book... a book that outrages some inspires others and launches the Protestant Reformation.The devout Anne Boleyn catches the eye of a powerful king and uses her influence to champion an English translation of the BibleScriptures the common people could read for themselves.

This book starts with the story of a dying woman in our time. She is visited by a strange figure nobody else can see an Angel called The Scribe. He wants her to record the story he is about to tell out of The Tablets of Destiny.  He begins with Rose a suicidal woman who ends up in the household of Thomas More. She is devoted to God until she reads the forbidden book from Hutchins. More is trying to persecute everyone who dares to read this book because its against God and the law. These heretics must burn for their sins. Thats why More refuses to sign the Act of Supremacy and he is willing to give his life for it.  Between this story we get glimpses of Anne Boleyns life. She is sent to court to serve Catherine as a humble submission because her sister Mary is pregnant from King Henrys child. Henry lays his eyes on Anna but she refuses to become his mistress. Thats how Henry starts to get rid of Catherine. Anne is going to be the one to give him an heir but when she only gives him a daughter its time to get another wife.  Review.  I was surprised by the beginning of this book and it was very confusing first. Bridget is in a hospital waiting do die from cancer. She used to be an author and The Scribe wants her to write down the story. When he first starts about Angels and Archangels I almost thought I had the wrong book in front of me. Despite the strange start I thought it was an enjoyable book.  Roses story was the least interesting. I felt disconnected from her and I felt like I missed important pieces of her life to truly understand her. I liked the fact that I got to see more of Mores life. His passion for God and his strange way to show it  burning other people on the stake  were fascinating. The main reason why I wanted to read this book was Anne Boleyn. I loved the original approach. Instead of making her the seducing manipulating girl Garrett portrayed her as innocent and faithful. This was so different from all the books Ive read so far and from the television show  I really liked it.  Conclusion.  Im still not sure if the beginning of this book fits to the story. I was left with some questions about The Scribe and why he wanted to record these stories. I dont know why Rose story was so important but it was interested to see the impact of Henrys decisions among the people. The take on Anne Boleyn was refreshing. All together a good book but I dont feel the need to pick up part 2 soon.  Anne knew her temper was flushing her cheeks. I will not speak of that night nor will I speak of the future. I will speak only on what I know today. I have not read this book of Leviticus but I know my prayers. You have a wife. I will never consent to be a mistress.;Ginger Garrett

He offers her some food and wine and she gives him an invisibility cloak and a special black wool.  When he arrives at his uncles house he finds out that his uncle is the head gardener in the Palace and he also gets a job there as gardener. He meets Rose but she becomes very sick and her other eleven sisters too. Still they keep dancing on a place nobody knows and they are becoming sicker every morning. Their father is so worried he decides to make a plan. The princesses cant tell him where they go because of the curse so he invites princes through whole the country to help. If they find out where the princesses are going they can marry one of the princesses. Unfortunately no one is able to find out and every prince dies in a strange accident.  That gives another problem. There is a lot of attention for this mysterious happening and they are accused of witchcraft. Galen who is very fond of Rose  the eldest princess decides to take a chance. The king accepts and Galen finds out where the princesses are going every night. They are cursed by The King Under Stone. Their mother wasnt capable of becoming pregnant so she made a deal with The King. She died before she could pay her debt and now they must pay the price for it. With his invisibility cloak and some clever thinking he manages to saves the twelve girls. He breaks the curse and he can marry one of them. Of course its Rose. They are so cute together Galen sounds like someone everybody wants as a boyfriend. I think its so cool that he can knit.  I loved how every princess got their own character. Most of the story is fixed on Rose but you have the brave Poppy and her twin Daisy and the very religious Hyacint. The next book which Im reading right now is about Poppy.

Can they win this war before it is too late  While I liked the plot (even when it was very predictable) and the action I started to get really annoyed by Clary and her stupid behavior.

Im not sure what has gotten into her but I couldnt stand her She throws herself into these dangerous situations and I wanted to slap her in the face multiple times.  I liked Valentine as the villain I only wished that he appeared sooner in the story because I got a little bored sometimes. It was because of that endless dragging about the sisterbrother relation between Clary and Jace. Just get over it already. Tell me what is going on and continue with the real story. Im not sure if Im going to read the other books. Im very satisfied with this ending and Im afraid that the other books are just a waste of time.

This book is hard for me to review since I have no idea how I really feel about it. Zara is most of the time a nice character. She is forced to live with her grandmother after the death of her (step)father. Her mother thinks its better for her to change the environment. Zara feels like her mother is abandoning her and I hated the way she acts towards her mom. She is trying to fix the situation. Zara doesnt answer the phone calls and if she does shes mean and harsh.  Living with her grandmother is okay. Its a tough old woman who is still working. When Zara finds out some stranger is stalking her her grandmother puts Nick on duty he must keep an eye on Zara. Not that it bothers her since she has a slight crush on Nick. He is nice to her and his looks are fine so he has her interest.  Then you have Issie I loved that girl. She is a bit goofy but so sweet. Devon a guy in a wheel chair Ian  another hottie according to Zara  and Megan a popular girl who hates her guts right away.  Devon and Issie are researching about the stalker and right away they believe a Pixie King has set his eyes on Zara. I dont know about you but that would be the last thing I would come up with.. They are so certain about it and Zara believes them not 100 but she keeps it in mind.  When Zara points at the stalker when she comes home with Nick  because in the end Issie and Devon are right  she finds out that Nick is a shape shifter. He can transform himself into wolf. And by the way her grandmother is a tiger. Not to mention that her real father is the one who has been stalking her yup the Pixie King. Great I hope you can feel the sarcasm over here  Apparently he wants her mother back because he is losing his power over the other Pixies. Her mother comes for the rescue but Zara cant let that happen. Even when she is acting like a cry baby and a total bitch she wants to save her mother. She comes up with a smart plan and she saves the day.  Alright.. There were a lot of things I liked but also a lot if things I didnt like. Zara was like I said in the beginning a pretty nice main character. Her instant love with Nick and her fling with Ian not very realistic. The way she finds out about the Pixie King even weirder.  What I really liked were the phobias. Its always a good thing to learn while reading and Ive learned about some new phobias.  Overal okay read.;Carrie Jones

After an unsuccessful attempt for a promnight spell she is sent to Hecate Hall (also Hex Hall) on Graymalkin Island. This school is for Prodigium (also known as witches faeries shapeshifters werewolves etc) Shes not happy. She lives a good live together with her nongifted mother her father is a warlock but he is out of the picture. Still he is the one who sentence her to Hex Hall.By the end of her first day Sophie already made three powerful enemies. She also developed a crush on Archer a gorgeous warlock and she made friends with her roommate a girl who happens to be the only vampire in the school. The pinkcrazy Jenna.  But this room looked like it had been decorated by the unholy lovechild of Barbie and Strawberry Shortcake.  She also has the feeling that a ghost is stalking her but thats not possible right When Sophie learns about a mysterious predator who has been attacking students  and is still on the move  she knows that there is no way her school year will be boring. When the attacking continues and everybody blames Jenna Sophie tries to convince them that its an ancient secret society who is determined to destroy all Prodigium (short name) The Eye. But nobody could prepare her for the real killer because sometimes looks really deceive.  Opinion.  Oh how I loved this book Sophie is fantastic. She is witty sarcastic and sweet. Yes she develops a crush right away because the boy is hot as hell but it was nice to see that she waits until they grow to each other. And be honest I think we all had a crush in school on a boy because of his looks. It makes her a believable teenager.he really cracked me up. There is something about the way she says things in such a nonchalant way. I really could imagine her voice in my head. Just look at it her comment to Cal  who is the ground keeper (and he sounds attractive)  So if you can heal with your touch why are you working here as like Hagrid or whatever  There is also Jenna perhaps one of the biggest freaks in the school. She is so cool. Even when everybody blames her she tries to stand up for herself. Her room sounds horrible with all the pink but it gave her a real personality. Her story is touching.The ending of this book was great. I didnt see it coming. I knew that Sophie was powerful but I was pleasantly surprised by the conclusion. That brings me to the writing style. Its easy and fastpaced it was highly entertaining. Im so glad that there is a second book.You definitely need to read this book if you like funny easy books about magical creatures. You wont be disappointed because this book has everything. From danger and drama to romance.;Rachel Hawkins

It was a bit boring and it kept dragging on while nothing spectacular happened. In the end there wasnt so much going on and it was fixed in a rather easy way.  This story is told from the POV of the dog and the bear every chapter switched between them. The story picks up where the first one left. They are staying together and after a while there is a friendship between the two. When they find Unmagic in the woods they visit the wild man. He transforms the bear back into his real shape the human king Richoun. The dog takes also a human body and she will go by the name Chala. They must travel back to his kingdom to stop a war and they must find a solution for the one who is using his Unmagic.  pinion.  I felt disconnected from both of these characters. Chala is very distant and she keeps longing for her dog appearance. After a couple of times mentioning how it felt to be a dog I get the point. There were some interesting things about her. The clever way she sees certain situations and how she stays loyal to the king (due to her dog feelings) But I never got to know her enough. It was slightly better with the king but I dont know.. He lacked of something.  The story was like I said a bit boring. Especially in the beginning when they are in their animal form. There is nothing going on they just go on with their life and I kept waiting for something to happen. When they took their human form I expected the story to pick up but instead it went down hill. They travel a long time to his kingdom and again nothing happens. There is some treat of Unmagic but it stays too much on the background. The last couple of pages had a bit of action but that wasnt enough for me. I also missed the magical feeling and Im really started to wonder if Im going to read the next one. Perhaps just to finish this series but Im not sure.;Mette Ivie Harrison

The characters were okay. Overall okay nothing special.  Most of the things I know about Anastasia comes from the lovely movie (which is not made by Disney but by Fox animation studios. I hear that mistake often) and this book is pretty similar but misses the magic. Where I absolutely love the movie even if its not 100 accurate this book had too many flaws to really enjoy.  First of I couldnt connect with the characters. The two guys (already forgot their names Im sorry) are looking for a replacement of Anastasia because her grandmother offers a huge amount of money. There are rumors that she survived the murder on the Royal Family. One of the guys worked in the palace at that time and he saw how Anastasia was killed in front of his eyes. He is very skeptical about the rumors but they come across a tavern girl called Nadya. Her looks are remarkable and her amnesia about most of her past is very convenient. The only thing she knows is that she was taken from a mental institution. On their way they change her appearance and help her adapt to her possible new future. Nadya doesnt know that the two guys are in for the money and she falls in love with one (bet you didnt see that coming)  I just didnt feel it. Everyone is so distant and I didnt really care for Nadya. The reunion with her possible grandmother didnt touch me and meh. Didnt work for me.  The second thing is the fact that everything comes together SO easily. They HAPPEN to stumble across her. And no like I said the movie has something magical and here its just bland.;Suzanne Weyn

One thing that bothers me is the fact that the blurb is incorrect. How is that possible Graces grandmother always tells the magical tales and it is strange that they talk about the Snow Queen since the book only mentions the Winters child.  Summary.  Kai and Grave grew up together. Graces grandmother loved to tell magical tales especially the one about the Winters child there were a King and a Queen and they loved each other. When the Queen gave birth to a daughter she started to get worried about her looks. If she would lose her beauty surely the King would stop loving her. She became so obsessed with it that she locked herself away in a tower in front of a mirror. One day the Northern Wind caught sight of her beauty and he wanted to get her attention. He decided to pick up her baby but when that didnt work he dropped the child in the snow. From that moment on the baby girl was the Winter Child. She must mend the hearts of other people in the hope to become a normal girl again.  When Kai asks Grace to marry him she declines the offer for now. She wants to see more of the world she isnt ready to settle. Kai is hurt and when he sees the Winters child he wants to help her. He will return with her to her home. Grace is going after him when she finds out that Kai is gone and this is the start of a huge adventure.  Review.  There are different POVS in this book and I liked them. They gave insight in every story the Winters child Grace and Kai. The background story from the Winters child was fascinating. I liked the original approach of the Snow Queen. Most of the time we get to know her as an evil character. Here she is just a girl with her own quest. I liked Graces POV the most. She is a brave and stubborn girl. I admired her strength to follow Kai on her own. This decision will change the life of many characters.  What I didnt like was the rushed ending. I dont mind the fact that they all end up happily ever after but I wished Dokey spent more time on the romance. There was definitely room for a more developed ending.  This book was filled with some gorgeous quotes and I will share one  Pick any time of the day or night and somewhere everywhere stories are being told. They overlap and flow across one another then pull away again just as waves do upon a shore. It is this knack that stories have of rubbing up against one another that makes the world an interesting place a place of greater possibility than it would be if we told our tales alone. This is impossible of course. Make no mistake everyones story touches someone elses. And every brush of one life tale upon another be it ever so gentle creates something new a pathway that wasnt there before. The possibility to create a new tale.;Cameron Dokey

Review coming soon.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book is a loose retelling of Beauty and the beast and she manages to capture the sphere perfectly. As you might now Beauty and the beast is my favorite fairytale and she does it justice. The characters are flawed but have great characteristic features and you have to root for them. I liked the plot the pacing and the worldbuilding. This book is a reread for me but its just as good as the first time. It deserves its 5 rating without any doubt and I highly recommend this book (or any of her other work) Im so happy that I finally can review this book so more people might pick up this wonderful piece of work.  Summary.  Caitrin ran away from her abusive aunt and cousin after the death of her father. Her mother passed away years ago and her sister fled away in a marriage with a musician. Her father taught her the skills of writing and reading  when she arrives at a mysterious village she hears someone asking around for a translator. Caitrin accepts and comes to live in Whistling Tor with Anluan. He is troubled by a hundred years old curse and a wounded body. He is looking for a cure and Caitrin needs to translate old diaries to help him. She is sucked into the scary and bloody past where someone made an army from ghosts. Ghost only Anluan can control.  Review.  I liked the paranormal aspect and the original twist to the story. It makes the story a bit darker and interesting. The constant treat of the hoard and the rage they have gave this book a thrilling undertone. I also appreciate the fact that its not an obvious retelling this book can stand on its own.  One of the things I love about Marillier are her characters. Caitrin is an admirable young girl. Skilled with writing and reading (something that wasnt normal in this time period) loyal fierce and caring. I like how she starts to fall in love with Anluan despite his appearance and difficult temper. Anluan is plagued and tired of controlling the ghosts. He became a cripple when he was young  losing the control over his right side. This makes him insecure and he hides away in his castle. He is afraid to get close to Caitrin because he expects her to go away like everybody else. Caitrin is still able to see him for who he is and his constructed walls are falling down. Their slow romance was cute. Two broken people who are trying to find their place in life. They take care of each other and they are supportive. It was fun to see Anluan change from the bitter angry man to a leader who takes responsibilities. He has some great developed friends  I love these secondary characters. They completed the story for me. They all have distinct voices and an important place in the story.  Some twist to the story are a bit obvious but I was still amazed by the way Marillier blends everything together. Every little detail becomes an important part of the story and the ending is perfect. We get the climax this story deserves with all the pieces falling together. Everything is solved and they all get to have a happilyeverafter. Im very much looking forward to more books in this series although Im not sure well ever get them (;Juliet Marillier

Together with Breckin Babette en Milek Zira must try to find a way to break the curse before it is too late.  Long.  Zira is raised in the kitchen by Cook until she finds out that she is no servant girl. In fact she is the thirteenth princess and thats a nice suprise for her.  Aurelia is the first born child. After that the King made sure that there was no magic in his Kingdom. The nurse said it could be dangerous for Aurelia. Soon after that the other sisters arrived the twin Alanna and Ariadne. Althea Adena Asenka. Another twin Amina and Ailima. Akila Allegra Asmita and Anisa. The King was done with daughters he wanted a son. But when his wife dies giving birth to another daughter he is devastated. He doesnt want the child so he calls her Zira and she must be raised by the kitchen staff.  That is a horrible thing to do. Even in the end I never felt any sympathy towards the King. He is harsh for his daughters and he blames Zira for something that isnt her fault. What I did like was the fact that Zira and the princesses are so nice to each other. Zira can sleep in their room every sunday. There is a secret passage between the kitchen and their sleeping room. And sometimes a princess leaves a hidden note for Zira telling her that they miss her.  Zira feels wonderful and she even makes a new friend. Breckin a boy who works in the stables. What a sweetheart He sounds so cute and I liked how their feelings are developing. Its not that the author speaks about never ending love and passion  keep in mind that they are twelve  but its real. Its the kind of feeling everybody had when you were around that age. Together they find out that there is still a witch in their Kingdom. Her name is Babette and its a nice old woman. She always bakes cookies and other tasty stuff. Jummy She comes in handy when the trouble is coming  Something is terribly wrong. Her sisters are becoming very sick. They are tired all the time they cant get out of bed anymore. Zira discovers that they are cursed they must dance every night by going down in the dumbwaiter (the same spot Zira uses every sunday) under the lake. They must dance nonstop and thats why they are so tired. Zira must find a way to break the curse before it is too late. But how And who is behind the curse  Oh how I loved this twist on the original story It really sticks to the story but I love the addition of another sister. Zira is such a fun character She is very nice but stubborn at the same time. She knows what she wants and she is brave. I like the fact that even when she finds out that she is a princess she stays the same.;Diane Zahler Yvonne Gilbert

Will be posted on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Scarlet and Rosie March live with their grandmother in the forest because their mother left them. Their whole world is about to change when they get a visit from an unknown man. He attacks them its a wolf and he kills their grandmother. Scarlet is able to defend her and Rosie but is left with a lot of scars and she is blind at one eye. From that moment she is determined to protect other girls by hunting every single wolf she can find. She gets help from Silas their neighbor.  But something tells me the hospital staff wouldnt be too cool with a scarredup girl with an eye patch coming in and hacking up one of their patients.  After the prologue the story is told from two POVs. We get to take a look through Scarlets eye and Rosies eyes and that was a nice addition to the story. You really get to know both girls and you can understand their feelings much better this way. On one side Scarlet is obsessed with the hunt. She believes its their job. On the other side Rosie is torn between her sister and her life. She owes her life to Scarlet and therefore she will hunt but it doesnt satisfy her enough. Its Scarlets passion to hunt but Rosie wants more.  And she has the chance. They travel to another city because they heard about the rumors of a Potential. Thats a boy who is about to change after he is bitten by another wolf. Every pack of wolves is hunting for this Potential so they can add him to their group. Between hunting Silas gives Rosie a little present he pays for three little courses she can follow. Such as origami and taking dancing lessons. Rosie also feels something more for Silas than friendship.  Can they find the Potential before it is too late Can Rosie combine a real life with hunting or will that separate her from her Scarlet And what will happen with her feelings for Silas If you want to find out you better start reading this wonderful story  Conclusion.  Scarlet is a kick ass girl. Her body is proof enough because its filled with scars. After the death of her grandmother she totally lives for the hunt. Its her passion her calling. Armed with a razorsharp hatchet she is ready to kill every wolf who crosses her path.  That also made me sad because there is so much more to live for. Like Rosie who longs for something more. She is sweet and brave. Scarlet worries a lot about Rosie hunting alone but believe me she can handle a lot Silas was great. He is very loyal to his friends because he would sacrifice his life in order to safe them. He is also incredibly sweet towards Rosie.  I could see the plot coming but I still liked the twist. There were some surprising things though so not everything was predictable. I loved the fact that this retelling was so different from the real story while it still manages to capture the essence. The original story isnt one of my favorites but I really liked this one;Jackson Pearce

Instead of chasing fairies Ash learns to hunt with Kaisa. Though their friendship is as delicate as a new bloom it reawakens Ashs capacity for loveand her desire to live. But Sidhean has already claimed Ash for his own and she must make a choice between fairy tale dreams and true love.Entrancing empowering and romantic Ashis about the connection between life and love and solitude and death where transformation can come from even the deepest grief.;291;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1342965660m6363322.jpg;Ash;fantasy paranormal;Very adorable tale but it could use some adjustments. I like how there isnt a focus on the lesbian romance. Its just there and its nicely incorporated in this tale. I liked the original twists but I wish I felt more. The story is quite flat and I didnt feel the romance or attraction. But its still a wellwritten book. More detailed review coming soon.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This is an example of an okay book. It wasnt bad but it wasnt fantastic or lifechanging either. Its a solid retelling of Cinderella with an unique twist of LGBT love.  Ashs mother recently died and her father announces  after a couple of weeks traveling for his job  that he found a new wife with two kids. After a short sickbed her father dies and Ashs world changes in a drastic way. She has to leave everything she knows behind to life with her new family. In order to pay her fathers debts she has to work in their household as maid. Wandering around the forest Ash meets the elf Sidhean and the Royal Kings huntress Kaisa. She must keep her promise to Sidhean when he helps her but she cant ignore her growing feelings for Kaisa.  This is my first LGBT book but unfortunately the romance fell flat to me. I like that Malinda went there and how the romance is subtle. There is no focus on the fact that its about two lesbian girls and I love that. It didnt feel forced because love is love no matter the genders. The thing is I didnt feel the chemistry between Kaisa and Ash. They spend some time together and I can understand their friendship but love  What I also appreciate is the appearance of Sidhean. It was interesting to find out why he is so interested in Ash but the downside is that there isnt enough depth in his story. I dont understand his role and the solution from Ash to pay her debt to him was awkward and strange. I actually felt sad for him because Ash promised him things only to get better from it.  Id say to try this book if you want to look for something else in the fairy tale genre but dont expect too much from it.;Malinda Lo

Great characters some steamy scenes and a mystery. Love it Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Review  Meet Alexia. Stubborn soulless tempered and not afraid to say what she think. She lacks of the proper social etiquette and she doesnt fit in with her tanned skin large nose and curves  all features she thanks to her deceased Italian father. Her mother remarried and produced two empty headed girls. They are everything society can ask for busy with clothing and gossiping about fashion. Alexia likes to read and she loves to have conversations about science and politics. Her mother cant handle this behaviour and that is why Alexia became a spinster.  Meet Lord Maccon. Scottish bad tempered attractive and an Alpha werewolf. He has a lot of hilarious discussions with Alexia and its very clear that they like each other but they dont know it yet. He works for BUR a bureau that keeps track of all the registered supernaturals since the Age of Enlightenment. His beta professor Lyall is a gentleman and he always tries to calm him. They are both trying to investigate an important matter  Alexia was attacked by a vampire at a party. He wasnt part of a hive (community of vampires with a queen) and he also wasnt a registered rove (a vampire who decides to seperate like the eccentric Lord Akeldama. He is hilarious.) Where did this vampire came from And why are vampires and werewolves disappearing around town Lord Maccon is trying to keep Alexia out of his investigation but with no success. And when they finally find out what is going on it might be too late.  Conclusion  All right let me begin by saying I loved this book. Everything works. From the main characters to the secondary characters they are all fleshed out. Alexia is lovely and I like how smart and different she was. Her sexy scenes with Lord Maccon were great and I liked their interaction. Their constant bicker was funny the overall writingstyle is this book was fun. There is always some humour.  There is a subtle change in perspective and that works good. The telling voice sometimes switches to Lord Maccons POV so we get to see what he thinks of the situation. He is sweet and attractive in a nonperfect way. I wouldnt mind being in one room with him.  Another great aspect was the mystery. There is something scary going on and I liked how we slowly got to unravel it. The waxfaced man definitely gave me the creeps.  Please Lord Maccon use one of the cups. My delicate sensibilities.  The earl actually snorted.  My dear Miss Tarabotti if you possessed any such things you certainly have never shown them to me.;Gail Carriger

In Fallen you have Daniel and Luce in My name you have Lucy and Daniel. The last book also is about two lovers who share a previous life and only Daniel knows about it. But I must say I liked Fallen more.  When Luce and Daniel meet he shows absolutely no interest in her. Even when she tries to get more contact with him he ignores her. He does nothing to suggest that he likes her but that doesnt stop Luce. A girl who is supposed to be intelligent starts to stalk him. Thats something about Daniel I liked. He avoided her as much as he could but after that my feelings for him went downhill very quick. He falls into the same game you see in a lot of young adult books. He pushes her away and he pulls her towards him at the same time. He likes her but its not safe for her to be with him. Better yet kissing her will kill her.  Luce also annoyed me. She let Daniel play with her mind. He is a real jerk to her and there is nothing she does about it. The only thing she is whining about is the fact that he doesnt tell her whats going on. When he does she runs away. There is also a lot of complaining. Would he still likes me as much as I like him Would he miss me the way I miss him. Djees girl he fell down from Heaven to be with you what do you think  The real story is spoiled from the beginning. In the prologue everything is well explained. Its a shame because I wasnt blown away when the reveal came for Luce. It was clear from the beginning and since this book isnt such an exiting story..

It is written in a pretty dense style but my fascination with the Tudors and Dan Stevens voice was enough to make me sit through. This is definitely not the most enjoyable book Ive read about this time period but I liked that it was told from the perspective of Thomas Cromwell  and Dan does a fantastic job at using different voices for different characters. It made it easier to keep track of who was who.  Henry VIII is desperate to have his marriage to Katherine annulled so he can marry Anne Boleyn to get his wanted heir. He gets a lot of opposition especially from the pope and there comes Thomas Cromwell in the picture. He is an ambitious man who has to deal with the whims of the king. During this book we see Thomas and Anne both climb up the ladder but as we know neither of them are save.  I dont think I would have finished this as a physical book but in the end I am happy Dan Stevens guided me through the story that is interesting on itself.;Hilary Mantel

There is a slight hint of instant love but that really didnt matter Who could resist Ash In the beginning he is cold and mysterious but I love how we get to know him better. Puck is hilarious I like his sense of humor. Grimalkin is fantastic just like the cat from Alice in Wonderland. And last Meghan. The fact that she accepts everything so fast and that she doesnt hesitate to safe her brother great She is scared but she can still make great decisions.

Just to keep surprising me about books that after reading happen to be very good books.  This was one of the first books I began to read not knowing if I would like it. But it really got my attention. Jenna Fox awakes from a coma without any memory. She doesnt recognize her parents and even her own body feels strange. Than she finds out that her body is made out of a new substance because she was mortally wounded in a car crash. She finds out that shes illegal because her parents kept her alive against the rules. Her body is 90 fake (or something like that it has been a few days ago since I read this book) and she only has a little part of her own brains. Thats too much so if anbody would find out that shes still alive that would give a lot of trouble.  One of her new friends eventually gets very sick and Jennas parents will this girl in return for silence. Otherwise her parents will tell about the illegal procedures.  Years and years later you read how Jenna and this girl are still alive while Jennas boyfriend is dead. I dont know but that part really touched me.. I dont know if I would like to live this way the whole idea really freakes me out I hope that our society will never be able to do stuff like this cause itll really mess things up.  My conclusion a very good book that touches me and sometimes scared me.;Mary E. Pearson

It seems to lack of enough action because somtimes I got quite bored with the story. There wasnt enough to really hold my attention.  The story goes about the Swifter who is claimed by the new prince. She is bound to protect him but that doesnt mean that she believes him all the time. She doesnt trust him at all. Still she protects him and she even beginns to care for him. Theres only one little problem her talents are become less and less. She cant swift to an animal and magic is sometimes hard for her. Therefore she decides to go back to the forest to reclaim the magic and she stays there.  The prince comes back for her and there she saves him from an attempt to murder him. She has a little talk with the assassin and he claims to be the real heir of the realm instead of the imposter. Despite this little chat she returns with the prince to the castle and she must save him a couple more times.  I dont know.. It sounds good and the story has great potential but there was something that made this story a bit boring. I also think that it has something to do with the Swifter. Sometimes I disliked her a bit. One time shes very weak and shes afraid that her magic is gone. Than she becomes strong and unafraid. There was sometimes to much blablabla I guess.;Leah Cypess

She kept bitching about the fact that Sonia betrayed her. But it was not that Sonia had a choice. I really wanted to smack Lia and tell her to shut up about it. She messed up the whole friendship with everbody. Brigid was lovely And I fell in love with Gareth haha. He sounds adorable.  About the story. This time the game is on. Lia has decided that she cant longer wait to shut the gate for Samuel and his Souls. The call of the Souls becomes more tempted for her and she doesnt want them to enter the world. Theres only one way to do it end the Prophecy on the right time with all the keys and the stone on the right place. They already know everything about the Rite so they travel to Avebury. She even tried to pursuade her sister Alice  because they need her power  but that failed. Lia wants to try it anyway even if that means she will die attempting to resist Samuel. That took a lot of courageous and I respected her for that. Just when her relationship with Dimitri is developing in something more that a fling she might lose it because of her stubborn sister.

Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  My father hated those tales told me they were made up by the Council to frighten people. Fear is a strange thing he used to say. It has the power to make people close their eyes turn away. Nothing good grows out of fear.  Lexi lives with her mother uncle and sister Wren in the Moor at the edge of the village of Near. Its a closed community where everybody knows eachother. Strangers and witches are not welcome that rule is stated by The Council. Lexis father was different. He took her to the two witches who are living on the edge of the village and told her to respect them and the magic that surrounds them. He also taught her to be a hunter a tracker and she is quite good at it. When her father died her uncle became some sort of guardian. He is trying to protect her and her sister but Lexi is too strong. I loved the fact that she always stood up against him. Heroins should be brave they must not bow to the will of other men when they clearing are very wrong.  Back to the stroy.  The children are told about the Near witch as a bedtime story. When a stranger arrives everbody is talking about it. Especially when a boy dissapears and soon after him more children. Lexis uncle is the protector of the village and its his task to find the missing children. He is blinded in his search and soon the stranger is blamed for the missing children. Lexi knows where she can find him and she visit the witches where he is hiding. He is a bit strange. Sometimes it feels like he can vanish into the air like he is some kind of ghost. He doesnt want to talk about himself so Lexi gives him a name Cole. She decides that she can trust him. He is going to help her to find the children since her uncle has no clue.  Soon Lexi discovers the truth. What if the Near Witch never really died What if she came back to take revenge for her death When Wren her sister is also one of the missing children Lexi can think of only one thing. She must find out what happend to the Near Witch and better what can she do to get her sister back  Like is said Lexi is a nice character. I liked to see the world through her eyes. Moor and Near sounded very magical. She is kickass and I laughed couple of times. Her uncle tells her to stay inside five minutes later she is running in the forest to the Sisters.  At first I didnt like Cole. He was too distant but when you get to know him better he becomes a lovely character ) Wren is very cute  There is much action in this story. Its a bit slow sometimes and it takes some time to really develop but I enjoyed myself. If you like a book with a mysterical feeling to it you should definitely read this one;Victoria Schwab

This series is FUN. Carriger has such a humorous tone in her writingstyle and this book has everything I look for. A witty protagonist a grumpy Alpha werewolf supernatural creatures dialogues that make me laugh out loud mystery action and a fastpaced plot. Add some Steampunk elements and interesting sidekicks and you are in for a fantastic read It is safe to read this review if you havent read Soulless.  Alexia is married to Lord Maccon the grumpy Alpha werewolf. One day he just disappears and Alexia is left with a supernatural army camping in her garden. She soon finds out that there is an area where supernatural lose their supernaturalness. Alexa discovers that her husband took off to Scotland his original country to visit his old pack. There are rumors that this pack might have something to do with the area.I really liked where the plot was going to and I wasnt disappointed by the conclusion.  Carriger created a mysterious feeling and I was eager to find out what was causing this effect to supernaturals. The ending was shocking and made me want to dive into part 3 right away.Alexia belongs to a list of favorite characters. Witty smart and strong. Her Idontgiveadamn attitude is awesome and it brings her in some difficult situations. During her flight to Scotland someone is trying to murder her. She deals with that fact like someone just ate her favorite cookie a bit disappointed but nothing she cant handle. I love how she keeps her head cool but being a soulless does that to a person. Despite the fact that she doesnt have a soul she does have feelings. I love her chemistry with her husband. They are a perfect match and completely up against each other.  Lord Maccon is a very attractive strong and intelligent man. He is protective over Alexia (not that she needs it) and he has the same dontcare stance. Like walking around naked while he has visitors after his transformation. I dont think I would mind haha.There are some other great sidekicks as well. We see some old friends but I was fascinated by the new castmember Madame LeFoux. She dresses like a man and she is a scientist. Hidden under her hat store is a place where she crafts machines and she makes a weapon for Alexia a parasol with hidden weapons. Madame LeFoux is a lesbian woman and I love how she flirted by Alexia  Id almost ship them together.  What I really appreciated is the fact that all cliches are left behind. Carriger doesnt try to focus on the lesbian aspect its just part of her character. If you havent started this series what are you waiting for;Gail Carriger

He tells her it will be a wonderful experience but all Anna thinks about is what she leaves behind. A good job a best girlfriend her little brother and her crush.On her first day she meets Meredith and her friends especially Etienne St. Clair. He is this perfect boy every girl wants to be with  and every boy wants to be him. He has the looks the popularity and the personality. Only downfall is his egocentric dad who keeps Etienne away from his sick mother. Anna starts to fall in love with him but there is a little problem he has a girlfriend Ellie and he isnt planning on breaking up with her. He doesnt want to be lonely and he is afraid for his mother. Will they ever get together or will Anna stay with her fling Dave  Opinion.  As you can see I wasnt blown away by this book. This is the main reason why I try to stay away from hypes most of the time they dont deliver. Was it cute Definitely. Did I like the writingstyle Yes I did. So let me tell you why my rating is low.  1. Anna. Like all the other girls she falls in love with Etiennes looks right away. But she is actually pretty easy with her feelings because Dave is also in the picture  and not to forget the crush in her hometown. She develops a friendship with Etienne but she keeps whining that his gorgeous looks distract her and that she wants more. What she had to do was stay the hell away from him because he has a girlfriend.  2. Etienne. The perfect boy who has everything but to make the storyline a bit more complex throw in a sick mother and a bad father. Girls swoon around him and he never got the guts to tell Meredith that he doesnt like her. Poor naive girl. He stays into this bad relationship with Ellie because he is afraid to be alone Yeah alright. I dont like these perfect pretty boys and he just wasnt fair to Ellie and Anna.  3. All. the. drama. Anna and Etienne keep walking around each other in endless circles making a lot of fuss and drama in the meantime. Fighting staying friends wanting more fighting blablabla. Just get on with it already You like him he likes you the end. I have the feeling I actually read the same thing over and over again until they finally made their decision.  4. Alcohol. I dont like drinking but I know that its something personal. What I find distracting was the fact that the author made it seem like its perfectly normal to get wasted. Anna has never been drunk before and I liked that about her but after the whole pukeandlosemymemorysituation I had to roll my eyes.  5. Mean girls and boys. There were so many stereo types. Every girl Anna doesnt like is a mean girl (Amanda) and every boy Etienne dislikes is a bad guy (Dave). The only people in between are Meredith Josh and Rashmi who doesnt really play a bigger role than making Anna feel better about herself.I hope that I dont get all the fan girls hating on me now haha because everybody seem to love this book. I guess its also because I normally dont read these type of books.  Perhaps Perkins should have thrown in some zombies to make it more spectacular for me );Stephanie Perkins

I took 05 off because the beginning was slow but holy there was a point in the book where I was sucked into the story and I read the last 350 pages in one sitting. SO MANY FEELINGS.  Edit  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Nobody warned me about all the feelings in this book. I highly recommend that you DONT read the blurb for the second book. I was warned by Wendy in time because it contains a big spoiler for a twist that happens in this book. I must admit that it took me some time to get along with this story and characters. The beginning is awfully slow and I had to adjust to Miras writingstyle. Its a bit dense but halfway I was completely sucked into the book and I couldnt put it down. Its admirable how she crafted the story.  This review is spoilerfree.  We follow the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse called the Rising through the eyes of blog journalists Georgia Mason and her brother Shaun. Georgia and her team join the presidential campaign from Republican senator Peter Ryman. They get involved with deadly incidents which leads them to the discovery of a conspiracy. I already saw what was going on and who was behind it but it didnt matter for the enjoyment and pain I had at the ending.  The worldbuilding is interesting. Humans live in tightly controlled safe zones and you need special passes to get into certain areas. Bloggers have taken over as primary source of information. There are three important types Newsies like Georgia who make reports based on facts. Irwins like her brother Shaun who entertain and educate by poking things with sticks and Fictionals like their friend Buffy who write fictional content. The focus on bloggers was a nice addition.  We get explanations how the zombies arose and this information in sprinkled throughout the story via blog posts from Georgia and her brother Shaun. My microbiology heart was happy. The medical aspect is simply amazing and blew me away. Its sometimes hard to give a story a realistic background but Mira excelled in it. The principle is that there are two cures one for cancer and one for the common cold. These cures combined to form KellisAmberlee a quickly infecting virus that goes live or amplifies when someone dies or gets bitten. I liked how these plausible explanations changed this book from just another zombie story to something more.  I loved Georgia and Shaun and more specific their relationship. They grew up as brother and sister in a notsoloving family. Mother and father are too busy with their career but these two have a special strong bond. The teasing showed how much they cared about each other. Its not that I felt connected to them but I got wrapped up in their lives and I was worried about them.  ND THEN YOUR HEART IS SHATTERED AND YOU HAVE ALL THESE FEELINGS. DAMN YOU MIRA GRANT The alternative ending wasnt any better... The author doesnt shy away from shocking twists and brutal situations but I was surprised that the story never felt too dark. Yes there are zombies and yes there is bloodshed but the overall tone isnt depressing. Perhaps because the main focus isnt on the undead but on the conspiracy. I think people who tend to dislike zombie books will be able to enjoy this too.;Mira Grant

They arent rich but happy. When their need for money is high Jack is sent to sell their cow on the market.

She meets Jacks loveinterest Shannon and Robert son of Guy as Robin Hood. He doesnt agree with his fathers claim and he wants to help Gen to restore their Kingdoms.  Gen saves the day. She is the brain behind everything. Jack is someone who throws himself into a situation before he thinks. They are twins but very different and I liked their interaction. When he is caught by Guy Gen comes up with a clever plan. I liked how downtoearth and witty she was. When she faces her enemy she stays cool and smart.

Princes and princesses would exchange in the hope of marriages and therefore political alliances. Poppy meets interesting people especially Prince Christian. There was a connection between them but troubles are waiting. Prepare for the dark twist on Cinderella.  There comes a new servant named EleanorEllenLady Ella (yes she loves different names) and she messes everything up. She is clumsy and has a sad past. Her father was a rich man but lost all his money and he died leaving Eleanor alone. She is tired of working as a maid so when her fairy godmother speaks to hear she knows exactly what to do. She is going to attend several balls and she is going to marry Prince Christian. It sounds good and she is so naive. After all everything has its price but she is filled with joy.  In the beginning everything works out pretty fine. She dances with Prince Christian and all the man are instantly in love with her because of the spell. They cant see who she really is expect for Poppy and Roland  they are wearing protective charms. In order to show everybody the real Lady Ella they make a potion and Poppy makes special bracelets. Prince Christian feels awful. One part of his mind wants to marry Lady Ella but the other half is truly in love with Poppy. He wants to help them out and when they find Eleanor crying they decide that things must change.  On the masked ball Poppy is acting as Lady Ella (which means she must dance but she quite enjoys herself in the arms of prince Christian). When she is summoned before the clock strikes twelve she realizes they made a big mistake. The fairy godmother called The Corley is not stupid. She kidnapped Lady Ella and she is going to play. If Christian can find his true love they are free. If not Poppy must stay with her forever.  I loved this story The dark twist on Cinderella was excellent. The story behind The Corley was clever and the characters in this book were very good. Poppy is intelligent snappy and she can be very sarcastic (something I like). She is very good with cards and she is so strong yet sweet and caring. Prince Christian is a perfect match for her because in the end he recognized his true love and he saved her. Eleanor yeah.. She is a bit stupid but I felt pity for her. Imagine it from having servants to being one. It must be tough especially when everything is corrupted by the fairy godmother.  What I liked was that you can read this book as a stand alone. If you havent read the first one there are subtle explanations for the fact that Poppy hates dancing. Another magnificent fairytale retelling I think Im going to add this author to my favorite list.;Jessica Day George

One gloomy windswept morning as she stands in a convent garden overlooking the icy sea she witnesses a miracle a glittering mermaid emerging from the waves a nearly drowned man in her arms. By the time Margrethe reaches the shore the mermaid has disappeared into the sea. As Margrethe nurses the handsome stranger back to health she learns that not only is he a prince he is also the son of her fathers greatest rival. Sure that the mermaid brought this man to her for a reason Margrethe devises a plan to bring peace to her kingdom.Meanwhile the mermaid Princess Lenia longs to return to the human man she carried to safety. She is willing to trade her home her voice and even her health for legs and the chance to win his heart...A surprising take on the classic tale Mermaidis the story of two women with everything to lose. It will make you think twice about the fairy tale you heard as a child keeping you in suspense until the very last page.;240;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1289262001m7320740.jpg;Mermaid;fantasy paranormal;Also featured on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Ive read this book and I became hooked with her writing. I really liked it.  The story goes about two girls. One is Lenia a mermaid princess. The other is Margarethe a human princess.  Lenia always felt a desire to be human. To have a soul. Shes totally obsessed with it and she loves the stories her grandmother tells her about the upper world. When she turns 18 she is allowed to take a peek. (Nobody else can because they are afraid that the humans will kill them like several years ago) She gets caught up in a storm and she notices a ship. The men are dying but she saves one of them. A boy she immediately falls in love with (bit unrealistic but very romantic at the same time.) She swam with him to shore and there she meets Margarethe. Margareth is at a nunnery because her land is in some kind of war with another land. She takes the man into the nunnery.  Then a lot of things happen see for yourself.  Lenia wants to be human that she sacrifices a lot. She must marry the prince then shell get a soul. If he marries someone else shell became foam like all the other mermaids when they die. (And she sacrifices her voice her family and everytime shell walk her feet will feel like theyre pierced by knives).  I felt really sad during the end. I know how the real story ended and I was afraid that this story would end that way too. Its slightly differend but still so sad;Carolyn Turgeon

Having angel blood run through her veins not only makes her smarter stronger and faster than humans (a word she realizes that no longer applies to her) but it means she has a purpose something she was put on this earth to do. Figuring out what that is though isnt easy.Her visions of a raging forest fire and an alluring stranger lead her to a new school in a new town. When she meets Christian who turns out to be the boy of her dreams (literally) everything seems to fall into place and out of place at the same time. Because theres another guy Tucker who appeals to Claras less angelic side.As Clara tries to find her way in a world she no longer understands she encounters unseen dangers and choices she never thought shed have to make between honesty and deceit love and duty good and evil. When the fire from her vision finally ignites will Clara be ready to face her destinyUnearthly is a moving tale of love and fate and the struggle between following the rules and following your heart.;435;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1324782984m7488244.jpg;Unearthly (Unearthly 1);fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Summary  Clara Gardner has angelblood and when she is having visions about a boy she moves with her mother and brother Jeffrey to a little town. Thats where she finally meets him popular Christian. He is from now on her purpose and slowly Clara unravels what she needs to do to help Christian. That is not so easy when Tucker comes into the picture. He is distracting her and the two of them are falling in love. But what if faith decides that you are meant to be with someone else  In the mean time Clara is learning all these new things about Angels from her new friend. There is a war going on between Good and Bad. The Bad side are the Dark Wings also the fallen Angels and it seems that her mother is familiar with them when she meets Dark Wing Sam.  Claras life is definitely not the life of an average teenager.  Review.  The first thing that really surprised me is the fact that the characters are so welldeveloped. Clara is a good character. Yes she has some whiny moments but they felt very realistic. Keep in mind that she is only seventeen years old and her life is turning upside down while she is trying to figure out her purpose. She was capable of making smart decisions she is stubborn and overall someone I started to appreciate.  I wont be that girl who lets the guy treat her like crap and still fawns all over him. Go Clara  Tucker stole my heart. There is something about him that makes me melt and I am leaning towards him. Christian is definitely not a bad character. The only thing that bothers me is that he is one of the same perfect gorgeous and popular. He is sweet but I prefer him as a good friend of Clara. I wasnt looking forward to the lovetriangle but I found it very acceptable. It worked for me.  That being said I struggled with the beginning. The story grew slowly on me and when that happened I couldnt put it down. The information we get about the Angels Claras search of her purpose accompanied with the visions and the meeting with the Dark Wing I really liked it. There was enough balance between romance and mystery to make me excited.  Another thing I appreciated was the family aspect. Clary lives together with her mom part Angel and her brother Jeffrey. There is a good dynamic between the three of them. They have their struggles like a normal family but its very clear that they love each other. I cant wait to see more of Jeffrey because I have the feeling there is more story to him.  Conclusion.  This book was definitely better than expected It wasnt filled with cliches and I liked the refreshing take on Angels. The lovetriangle did work for me and Im happy that the romance didnt play the main role in this book. I will be reading part two Hallowed soon and Im very excited about it.  So often we only do what we think is expected of us when we are capable of so much more.;Cynthia Hand

Though he lives in the small town of Gentry he comes from a world of tunnels and black murky water a world of living dead girls ruled by a little tattooed princess. He is a Replacement left in the crib of a human baby sixteen years ago. Now because of fatal allergies to iron blood and consecrated ground Mackie is fighting to survive in the human world.Mackie would give anything to live among us to practice on his bass or spend time with his crush Tate. But when Tates baby sister goes missing Mackie is drawn irrevocably into the underworld of Gentry known as Mayhem. He must face the dark creatures of the Slag Heaps and find his rightful place in our world or theirs.;343;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1360176667m7507908.jpg;The Replacement;fantasy paranormal;The Replacement Do you really want to know where we come from she said. In every century in every country theyll call us something different. Theyll say were ghosts angels demons elemental spirits and giving us a name doesnt help anybody. When did a name change what someone is  I wished I loved this book. I was looking forward to read it because the blurb sounds amazing and look at the cover Its so dark and beautiful in a twisted way. Unfortunately this book didnt meet my expectations and I will tell you why in a minutee.Tates little sister Nathalie is dead at least thats what everybody pretends. They bury the body but Tate knows that this is a replacement. Everybody knows about it but nobody talks. As long as you dont say it out loud you can pretend that everything is fine. Not for Tate.She tries to talk to Mackie a boy who is different. He is alive because of Emma his loving sister (this is explained in the book.) His father always tells him to stay low so he turns away from her. That is until strange people talk to him and tell him that he is dying.One day he goes to the world he actually comes from and he receives a special medication. In return for that he must play in their music band to keep the people from Gentry happy. Things are about to change when Mackie discovers his feelings for Tate he will help her to get her Nathalie back but that wont be an easy task. The Lady is planning to sacrifice the little girl and she will do everything to make sure it will happen.  Opinion.  This story is told from Mackies view. I always like a male POV since there arent so many books but he wasnt such a thrilling person. I expected more from a Replacement than whining and lusting after unkind Alice until he decides he likes Tate. Tate is a tough girl but she has a slight stalker behavior. She keeps popping up around Mackie forcing him to say out loud that he is a Replacement. Leave the damn boy alone It also feels like she hates him but she still takes her clothes off and kisses him in a whim. I didnt get it. The only person I liked was Emma. She is loving and sweet. She stands up for her own believes.The story is slow and the writing isnt very good. There are many strange lines where words contradict each other.  Like she is strange and normal how is that possible There were also weird things going on. Giving rock concerts to make the people of Gentry happen but you still steal their children to sacrifice them for your own good And that would make the town prosper but it doesnt sound like they have much happiness and richness. They are suffering.There is also a lot of dialogs about the same subject. It felt like I read the same thing twice. I cant go into details of the plot without spoiling it but there are some holes. Just strange things I dont understand and I hate that. When a book ends I want answers to all my questions and I want it to be solid.I guess this just wasnt my book because I saw many positive reviews on Goodreads. What I really liked was the cover Gorgeous And I will read another book from this author perhaps that one works for me.;Brenna Yovanoff

Theres not so much action but it still captured my attention. We get to meet Lia and Alice who lived with their father aunt and two brothers. Now their father is dead and strange things are happening. Lia has suddenly marks on her wrist and they become more visible every day. Her twin sister Alice is acting strange  although their relationship has never been very strong  and they rarely talk to each other.  When Alice slips away during school time Lia decides to follow her with Luisa (an Italian girl everybody ignores). Alice is leaving to see a medium called Sonia and she wants the girl to contact her father. It goes not according to plan and Sonia sent them away.  Alice is frustrated and Lia becomes even more confused. What is going on And when Lia and Sonia meet in  what Lia thought it was  a dream every time becomes even more confusing. When the father of her boyfriend gives her an old book that he found in a hidden compartment of her fathers bookcase she get to know more about the situation. Theres a story in it that tells about the Prophecy of the sisters. A twin one the Gate one the Guardian. Four keys to unlock the Gate or close the Gate forever. They can release Satan and his souls to make chaos in the world or they can make them disappear forever. Sonia and Luisa also have marks around their wrists so whats their role in this story  I avoid looking at the clock fearing the slow passing of time that will only seem slower if I watch its progress.  Lia is a likeable girl. Alice is sucked into her own world and theres only one thing she wants and she will do anything to get it. The only thing that I dont liked was the fact that Lia accepts everything so easily. I think that I would need a lot of time to adjust to the fact that I can destroy or save the world. Not to mention the fact that her soul can wonder in the Otherworlds. I liked Sonia and Luisa. They are both very nice and brave.  I will definitely read the next book very soon because I want to know what will happen next Theres one thing I noticed while looking on Goodreads you love this book or you hate this book theres no other way. People gave this book 45 stars or just 1 star so you just have to find out on which side youre on );Michelle Zink

Its very instantlove and I didnt like it so much in this situation. I wished there was a little more development because there was room enough to allow that. Thats why I rated this book with 3 princesses instead of the 4 I wanted to give.  The writingstyle is great. It reads easy and fast. I finished it in two hours.

I think the charactes in this book are really sweet. It nice to see such a version of Snow White with all the magic and stuff happening. And the fact that the seven dwarfs are totally different than in the real story. I must say that I loved those guys (and girl). They were so friendly and protective for eachother. And I also liked that she didnt end with a prince but with the one she truly loves. Not like oooooh this is the first time I see you and you saved me I love you lets get married But were friends and I start to like you more and more.  I quite liked the fact that  eventhough its pretty naive  Snow was so forgiving. That she really wanted to believe that her stepmother changed.  Its a bit spoilerish so beware of that  Snow loses her mother when she was young and her father never looked at her again. She reminded him too much of her mother (who died during the birth) and he blames her for it. So she grew up as a strange duchess instead of leaning how to behave like a real woman she spents all her time in the kitchen. Instead of making nice clothes she climbs in trees with the boys. Thats something I like about her so much shes so alive and she doesnt worry about what people think.  But then there comes an end. Her father remarries for he wants a boy to take over the property when he dies. The woman is not capable of getting a child so she beginns to find other ways to make one. In the real meaning of making she wants Snows heart for it. Snow goes away  because of the warning Alan gives her  and she comes in the big city. She is lost and she wants to sleep but that place is already taken by Cat. And shes literally a cat a girl with cat eyes paws etc.  So thats how Snow comes to a group of thieves The lost ones. They must because nobody would hire people who look like animals. A raven a mouse a rat a cat a sparrow. But Snow manage to get herself a place as some sort of housemaid. Shes capable of it because Snow was a maid in her own household. There was a situation and she was blames for it (but it wasnt her fault in the first place.)  Now shes pretty happy at that place. She first winns their trust but soon they all become friends. Theres even a hint of love (and I love the fact that it grows not like BAM in love) Then she gets a message. Her stepmother has changed and she wants to meet Snow. Snow decides to do it but after their second meeting she gets in some kind of coma. For almost three years shes a sleep while her friends are searching for a cure. And when they find is Snow has no memory at all.  She goes back to her home where everybody is happy but she feels that something is wrong. At the ball here friends are there they found a way to give her memory back. She kisses Raven (the one she fell in love with) and her memory comes back. For true love can break any spell.  The magic her stepmother used bounces back. The woman forgets her own memory.

Only they know enough about the preternatural to explain her increasingly inconvenient condition but they may be worse than the vampires  and theyre armed with pesto.BLAMELESS is the third book of the Parasol Protectorate series a comedy of manners set in Victorian London full of werewolves vampires dirigibles and teadrinking.;355;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1293436281m7719355.jpg;Blameless (Parasol Protectorate 3);fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Blameless was fantastic. I was interested because of the ending of Changeless but I wasnt so sure what that would mean for this book but Carriger delivered. And the best part of it Alexia goes to Italy I read this when I was in Italy myself so that was a fun coincidence. You can read the review if you havent read any of the other books. That is something I really like about the blurbs. There are no spoilers whatsoever so credits for that.  Again filled with humor great characters and a fastpaced actionfilled plot.  Summary.  Alexia has been living in her parents house after Lord Maccons dismissal. He doesnt believe her and accuses her of something horrible. On top of that Queen Victoria dismisses her from her place in the Shadow Council when Alexia becomes a scandal. The only person who could help her her friendvampire Lord Akeldama had disappeared. Alexia decides to take things into her own hands and together with a group of friends among them Madame LeFoux she heads towards Italy. The Templars might know something about her secret but she is surprised when they have other things in mind. In the mean while Professor Lyall Beta from Lord Maccon tries to get things in control. He keeps talking to Lord Maccons conscious until he breaks through. Lord Maccon is ashamed of himself and wants to find Alexia but first he has to help Lord Akeldama.  Review.  I LOVED the drama. Things are spinning out of control and there is chaos everywhere. We have separate storylines but they all come together in the end. Lord Akeldama a character I adore tries to find his stolen object. When they find out who is behind it the true mystery starts to unravel. Vampires are trying to kill Alexia because they are afraid for her.  The biological background in this story explained by a very strange German man was fantastic. I was fascinated by his concept of being a supernaturalsoulless. This explains why the Templars are keeping Alexia captive. Its a shame that Italy wasnt explored that much but the idea that she was there was nice.  I liked the characters like always. Even when she is turned down by her husband hunted by vampires and mechanical bugs scandalized in the news and locked in a prison Alexias spirit doesnt break. She stays calm and strong. I like how realistic her feelings were towards Lord Maccon and how she is trying to show him that she is right. She would love to rub him the truth in his face but she is still able to forgive him. I liked to see how he changes. His initial reaction mostly out of fear turns into shame when he realizes that he is wrong. Its obvious that he loves Alexia and I like their dynamic.

First of this book is creepy Dont let the thickness of this book stop you from reading this one because its a great story with interesting characters. Im happy we decided to pick this book up for our book club otherwise I wouldnt have read this one any time soon.  Naughty John has come home. And he has work to do.  Evie is sent to her uncle Will owner from the Museum for creepy things American folklore superstition and occult after a drama between her and a guy. She used her powers on him and now he is mad she told everyone his secret. Evie is able to get information about people when she touches something personal. That power can come in handy because her uncle is asked to help in a mysterious murder case. Someone is killing random people and heshe leaves marks on their body.  I loved how we slowly got more information about the killer and why he murders all those people. The chapters about Naughty John scared me he is one creepy character. The part where he enters Evies dream and tells her he can see her and he is coming for her.. Or when she enters his house and he calls for her because the house is sortof alive.. shivers  Okay moving on to the other characters. I liked Evie. She can be a bit rash and inconsiderate for the people around her but her heart is in the right place. She is feisty intelligent and definitely not a scarypants. I absolutely loved her banter with Sam the guy who stole her money when she arrived in New York. He got a job at Wills museum and Evie does everything to make him feel unwanted. I was rooting for them but her strange and completely unexpected romance with another character came in the way. I wasnt feeling it.  There are also chapters that switch to other POVs like Memphis and his brother Isaiah. Memphis had powers in the past but he lost them after he tried to heal his mother. Isaiah is able to tell the future through his dreams and he is training with two older woman. They also have a small role where they tell that The Diviners are coming although you still have no clue what is exactly going on at the end of this book.  That was the most frustrating thing. You read this huge book filled with characters and small peeks of information but in the end you are just as clueless as when you started it. It also took too long before all the stories came together so I still dont know what role Memphis and his brother are going to play. This made the story a little slow at times. Nevertheless a good solid book with a great setting and interesting cast. Im up for more;Libba Bray

Daniel promises she will be safe here protected from those who would kill her. At the school Luce discovers what the Shadows that have followed her all her life mean  and how to manipulate them to see into her other lives. Yet the more Luce learns about herself the more she realizes that the past is her only key to unlocking her future . . . and that Daniel hasnt told her everything. What if his version of the past isnt actually the way things happened . . . what if Luce was really meant to be with someone elseThe second novel in the addictive FALLEN series...where love never dies.;452;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1362339749m7740152.jpg;Torment (Fallen 2);fantasy paranormal; spoiler alert   Luce wordt naar een veilige school gebracht waar Nephilims zitten. Een soort halfengelen. Op die manier kunnen de blinde Engelen die achter haar aan zitten haar levensvuur niet zo snel oppikken. Het signaal wordt als het ware verstoord. Luce luistert echter niet naar Daniels adviezen  om zich op de achtergrond te houden en niet uit de buurt van de school te komen  en brengt zichzelf daardoor in gevaar. Ze gaat zelfs zover dat ze probeert de geheimen van de schaduwen te lezen die al die jaren al om haar heen hangen.  Op deze school ontmoet ze Shelby  Miles (hij is echt leuk Snap niet waarom ze niet voor hem gaat). Zij helpen haar om antwoorden te krijgen op haar brandende vragen. Daniel wil haar immers niet helpen en ze is niet van plan om onwetend te blijven. Het enige probleem is dat iedereen op school op de hoogte is van haar liefdesverhaal met Daniel (dat zij al die keren sterft en dat hij dan op zoek gaat naar haar nieuwe ik) waardoor ze extra in de gaten wordt gehouden.  Elke keer als Luce en Daniel elkaar zien hebben ze ruzie. Hij vindt dat ze onverantwoordelijk is zij vindt hem onredelijk en haat het dat hij haar niets wil vertellen. Zo komt ze er pas heel laat achter dat Cam momenteel bij de goede kant hoort net zoals Roland en Molly. Een wapenstilstand maar hoe loopt dat straks af  Uiteindelijk mag Luce nadat ze een soort huisarrest heeft gekregen naar huis met Thanksgiving. Ze neemt Shelby en Miles mee maar als ze thuis aan komt arriveren Daniel Molly Cam en Roland ook. Ze begrijpt niet zo goed wat er aan de hand is maar dat is al snel nodig. De hel barst los als haar ouders de hond uit laten de blinde Engelen hebben haar gelokaliseerd. En dan komt Luce erachter waarom ze haar zoeken ze hebben haar nodig om terug te keren in de hemel. Hoe en waarom dat wordt niet duidelijk.  Luce wordt zo moe van alle onbeantwoorde vragen en het vervelende gedrag van Daniel dat ze een schaduw oproept hem opent en er vervolgens in verdwijnt terwijl iedereen haar waarschuwt dat niet te doen.    Mijn mening in het algemeen is dat het een aardig boek is en een leuk vervolg. Het constante ik wil je en ga weg is storend. Het afstoten een aantrekken. Het gezeur en het getwijfel. Of je vindt elkaar aardig of je hebt ruzie niet een beetje van allebei.  Het eeuwige jij bent mijn grote liefde ik kan nooit meer zonder je en ik zal altijd naar je op zoek gaan verveelt een beetje. Net zoals de terugkerende zoenscenes waarin ze een stukje vliegen hun liefde voor elkaar beschrijven en vervolgens ruzie maken.  Miles en Shelby vind ik echt ontzettend leuk. Zij zorgen ervoor dat dit boek leuk is. Ze voegen echt iets toe aan het verhaal en zoals ik al eerder zei Miles is zoveel leuker dan Daniel. Wat een schatje  Daniel betuttelt Luce ook veel te veel. Je mag haar heus wel wat meer vertellen ze is geen baby meer. Ik snap dat hij bang is dat ze opeens als een soort Feniks in de fik vliegt en vergaat maar ik zou ook gek worden van al die vragen. En het wordt er niet beter op want ze gaat nu alleen op onderzoek uit en dat is gevaarlijker.  Ik vind de strijd tussen goed en kwaad wel spannend. En hoe zit het nou precies met die blinde Engelen Hoe kan Luce ze de hemel in helpen  Het laatste hoofdstuk vanuit Daniel geschreven was een leuke toevoeging. Grappig om de situatie vanuit hem te lezen.;Lauren Kate

As war looms between Summer and Winter Meghan knows that the real danger comes from the Iron feyironbound faeries that only she and her absent prince have seen. But no one believes her.Worse Meghans own fey powers have been cut off. Shes stuck in Faery with only her wits for help. Trusting anyone would be foolish. Trusting a seeming traitor could be deadly.

I was minding my own business long before you and the princess started humping like rabbits.  This book picks up where we left. Meghan went with Ash to the Winter court after saving her brother Ethan from the Iron Fey. She killed the king but the treat isnt over yet its about to begin. When Meghan is summoned to the Winter queen Mab she finds out that the queen has her doubts about the Iron Fey. Mab is also pissed at her because she tricked Ash into helping her. When Sage is killed and the scepter is stolen Mab is furious this is the work of the Summer court A war is coming while the Iron Fey stole the scepter. Nobody expect Ash believes Meghan and they must flee to return the scepter before the war starts.  Luckily for us Puck is back Grimalkin is there to help them of course and they get a strange new ally. Its Ironhorse and he wants to help them because his new King is a fraud. Ash decides its too dangerous for Meghan and he goes his own way. Unfortunately that doesnt turn out well Ash falls into the hands of Virus an Iron Fey. She can implant robots into the brains of her victims so she can control them.  Can Meghan safe Ash before it is too late  Conclusion.  I must say that in the beginning I was a bit annoyed by Meghan. Her feelings for Ash are pretty strong and his cold and distant behavior makes her sad. Sometimes it was a bit too swoony. I was glad that it changes fast because there are a lot of things going on. Puck returns to help them and a love triangle is forming. Most of the times I hate it when this happens but here I understood where it comes from. Puck has been her friend for a long time and Ash has turned his back on her. Its not strange that Meghans feelings are messed up.  Ironhorse was wonderful. Its so cool that he is able to transform his body into a human shape. I could imagine his booming voice while reading his lines. The little but important role from Leanansidhe was lovely. I think she will play another part in the next book.  I also liked the use of humor in this book. I found myself laughing out loud a couple of times. The writing style was exactly like the first book so I liked it of course Ash is great. I love how he stood up for his feelings at the end of this book. How he made the tough decision giving up everything he knows.  Two swoony quotes.  He was real. He was here not dying in a tree somewhere left behind and forgotten. I missed you I whispered against his neck.  He held me tighter. Ill always come back for you he murmured sounding so unlike himself that I pulled back and looked at him. For a moment his green eyes were intense and I caught my breath at the emotion smoldering within.  Youre kind of blind you know Puck whispered smiling to soften his words. I wouldnt defy Oberon for just anyone. But for you... He leaned forward touching his forehead to mine. Id come back from the dead for you.  So yeah I might have a little fling on Puck. Perhaps more than on Ash because Puck seems like such a loyal and sweet boy. Normally Im not crazy about all these swoony scenes but these are just too cute. Julie knows how to write them in a good way.;Julie Kagawa

Again an amazing book. This story tells about Marys daughter Gabry (short for Gabrielle). They live in the lighthouse near Vista. Gabry is in love with Catcher the brother of her best friend Cassie.

Her life gets a total different spin when she meets Elias and finds out about the secret her mother kept away from her for years.  The only thing I didnt really like was the fact that Gabry is so busy with boys in a world filled with dead and fear. She is sometimes a bit of a whiner but I also understood her feelings very well. Imagine that your world starts to crumble away because everybody you love change. Im really looking forward to read the next book so I can find out all the pieces of this puzzle ) And the writing is magnificent 3  Spoiler version.  This story picks up where we left in The forst of hands and teeth. It tells us about Marys daughter Gabry (short for Gabrielle.) They live in the lighthouse near Vista. Gabry is in love with Catcher the brother of her best friend Cassie. One night they decide to go over the wall and that will ruin their lives. A couple of her friends are infected including Catcher. When the militia arrives Gabry finds a way to return to her house.  The next day everybody gets their punishment. Catcher managed to get away too but Cassie and some other girls are sent to the Recruiters in The dark city. There are not so many people who stay alive after their service for three years. When Gabry talks to her Cassie has only one wish Gabry must search and find her brother. Gabry is terrified but eventually she decides that its the only thing she could do. She left her best friend so she goes after Catcher.  Thats when she meets Elias. He saves her when she is surrounded by Mudos. He is searching for his lost sister and in the mean time he kills Mudos. He saw Catcher and he is keeping an eye on the boy as soon as he turns Elias will decapitate him. Thats not the case Catcher is immune and that makes him valuable for the Recruiters. It means that he can walk amongst the Mudo and they wont notice him. He is one of them but at the same time he is still a human.  Gabry Elias Catcher and Cassie have to flee they go in the Forest of hands and teeth. Mary already left a couple of days ago to find the people she left behind and Gabry hopes to find her. She found out about the fact that Mary is not her real mother. Mary found her years ago in the forest. Perhaps she can find answers in the Forest but they must be carefull. The Recruiters are just a few steps behind them.  When the four of them arrive at Marys old village they find Mary with another man Harry (remember him) Thats when Gabry finds out that Jacob was her father. Her mother died giving birth to her and her twin sister Annah. Annah is the girl Elias is looking for one day he took her and Annah into the forest. Gabry got lost and Elias couldnt find the way back so he and Annah escaped to the Dark city. When he returned from his duty as a Recruiter Annah wasnt there.  Thats when the world changes even faster. Elias falls and breaks his leg so he cant escape from the Recruites. Cassie dies. Mary and Harry stay behind with Elias. Gabry must flee with Catcher (they cant have him because they will use him) and they manage to escape to the Dark City. But this part was terrifying I liked it so much. Elias promises to Gabry that he will find her.  Thats when the book ends unfortunately I am not ready to leave them behind. I loved Mary in the first book and I was glad that she played a role in this book. The fact that Harry and Jacob return in the story great I never thought that Gabry would have a twin and that Elias wasnt looking for his sister. Catcher is a great character I loved everything about him. From his sweet feelings towards Gabry to the fact that he resists his feelings to keep her save. Even in the end when its clear that Gabry left him for Elias he is there to support her.  Thats one thing I absolutely disliked about this book the way Gabry feelings switched so easily from Catcher to Elias. In one single moment she decides that she wants Elias instead of Catcher.. And Elias isnt so bad but I felt more sympathy towards Catcher ) She is also very busy with the whole EliasCatcher debate in her head even when her best friend is dying Girl there are more important things going on  The writing was fantastic. The story reads so fast and I enjoyed every word of it. Im ready The dark and hollow places because I cant wait to find out what will happen next.  Sometimes its those things you cant touch that you need to hold on the most.;Carrie Ryan

Dont you  I loved it. I wish that there are enough words for me to explain how wonderful this book is. Before I started I saw some negative reviews popping up. The main character was a Mary Sue she was annoying and it was too predictable. Im very glad that I dont agree with those opinions and that I could enjoy Maas story. I cant wait for part 2.  Summary.  Meet Celaena Sardothien one of Adarlans most notorious assassins. She is just a girl of eighteen years old but her reputation is terrifying. Someone betrayed her and now shes doomed to be a slave at the salt mines of Endovier hardly anyone survives the first year but Celaena still lives. Her body is broken but her mind is very much alive.  Say my name. Say Very well Dorian.  She rolled her eyes. If it pleases Your Magnanimous Holiness I shall call you by your first name.  Magnanimous Holiness Oh I like that one.  She gets a visit from the Crown Prince of Adarlan Dorian and his captain of the Royal Guard Chaol. They have something to offer if she wins the tournament to become Adarlans assassin for four years she will get her freedom back. If she loses she will return to the salt mines. Its not hard for her. Even her hate for the King and everything he has done wont stop her from trying to win the tournament.  At the castle living under the name Lillian Gordaina she makes new friends. One of them is the lovely Nehemia a princess from another country. Shes there for her own reason but Celaena is going to need her. Someone is using dark magic and Celeana must find out who it is and she must put a halt to it.  She also makes a lot of enemies and she must watch her back. Because how is she going to survive when a murderer is on the hunt for Champions  Opinion.  Ive never met a girl with more flaws than Celaena. She is arrogant she has a bad temper she is incredibly stubborn and she is too proud. But on the other hand she grew up under hard circumstances shes strong witty and loyal. Despite all her mistakes I loved her Shes anything but standard and that was very refreshing. She also developed throughout the story. The interactions between the characters were definitely one of the best points. Its always snarkysnappy and Im a huge fan of that.  Youll be sweating when I skin you alive and squish your eyeballs beneath my feet she muttered picking up the rapier.  The side characters were great. I understand her attraction to Dorian but I have more feelings for Chaol. I have the idea that we are going to see a lot more of him swoon. So yes there is a little hint to a lovetriangle but it never bothered me. I could understand all the feelings.  Not to forget Nehemia. This girl has quite some spirit and she and Celaena are a perfect match. The development of their friendship was great and I hope to see her back soon.  One of the things I found a bit lacking was the worldbuilding. There is a little information about the world but the whole story plays inside the castle and thats practically all we know. I wished there was more information about the time before the King took all the power. He is the bad guy and I understood why but I wished that I really got to hate him. I have the feeling that I will get the chance because in the last pages we get to see more of this cruel man. Thats a nice promise for part two.  This story is filled with action and it builds up toward the end which definitely delivers. You could see it coming but it was still satisfying. There wasnt a moment I felt bored. Theres always something going on and I had a wonderful time living with Celaena and her friends. I want to return soon so Im going on the hunt for the novellas.;Sarah J. Maas

Foolishly romantic yeah sure maybe but shed rather have dreams of Prince Charming than the reality of Mr. Wrong.  And thats exactly what Caitlyn Monahan a fifteen year old girl does.  She feels stuck in her own life. Her mother died when she was only four and she has the feeling that her dad and stepmom dont understand her. Her mother left her a tarot card the wheel of Fortune. So when she earns a scholarship to a French boarding school called Chateau de la Fortune it feels like fate. But theres more behind it than she could ever imagine.  Caitlyn always had these nightmares with ghostlike people in it The Screechers. Her dreams are becoming even stranger when she arrives at Chateau de la Fortune and thats how she meets Raphael. He is the only one who can see her and she must help him to find the heart. When she has so many nightmares she decides to stay awake and study in the library. Thats how she meets another girl Naomi who quickly becomes one of her best friends. When Caitlyn finally tells Naomi and Amalia about her dreams they want to help her.  Thats when the real ghost story starts but its not a freaky scary one. Its about losing and finding love. Its about the discovery that ghosts can be humans after all.  Lisa Cach did a good job in writing this story about De Medici Templars and witches. Caitlyn is fifteen years and you will notice that sometimes but overall she was nice. I especially liked Naomi. She could be a little snappy and that was a great touch.  The love story between Caitlyn and Raphael.. dont get me wrong I think that everybody is capable of falling in love no matter how old you are but they were only fifteen and nineteen years old. Its not that there was burning passion or deep feelings so I didnt really felt the connection. I liked the ending and the writing style was pleasant but I expected more from this one. It would have been better if Caitlyn was a bit older.;Lisa Cach

He has some debts and she is trying hard to help him. She makes jewellery and one day she stumbles into a strange shop. John Dee knows about her and he asks her to help him to open a silver box. He will give her a nice sum of money. Garet is intrigued by the symbol of a swan it resembles the swan from her ring. She feels like it means something but strange things happen when she opens the box. That evening the box is stolen and her father is shot.  Thats how Will Hughes comes into her life and he isnt just some person. His past is entangled with Garets past. He opens a whole new world for her and Garet finds out that she has an important role. Her mother was one of the Watchers and its Garets job to find John Dee. He is planning to destroy the world with the box he is now able to call out the demons of Despair and Discord. Together with the attractive Will and famous Oberon she is trying to track down John Dees hiding place before it is too late.  I liked Garet. Her life is turned upside down but she doesnt whine about it. She takes things as they are and she is pretty kickass. There is something special running through her veins and she learns some great tricks by visiting legends like Melusine. It was fun to see how some of these mythical creatures are supposed to be entwined with our lives. I loved their background stories. The other characters play a small role and I didnt really connect with them but I appreciated their input in Garets life.  The worldbuilding is good. We slowly unravel the situation and there was enough information to understand what is going on without getting boring. There is a constant pace that worked very well with the story and the writingstyle was fine.  The thing that bothered me is a minor spoiler so you will have to see for yourself but it has to do with the developing feelings between Garet and Will. It went a bit too fast for my taste despite the explanation about their special bond. Also the fact that Garet is willing to do something for him while she doesnt know him so long was strange in my eyes. I guess I just didnt see the sparks between them but I hope that it will develop in the sequel  a book I will definitely read because I want to see how this is going to continue.;Lee  Carroll

Her father was never there he left her mother before she found out that she was pregnant. Unfortunately her mother dies in an accident and Michele is forced to move to her wealthy grandparents she hates although she never met them before.  Eventually its not as bad as Michele expected. Her grandparents are kind even when they keep a certain distant. At school she beginns to make friends  theres even a boy who starts to like her  and then something strange happens. She finds an old key in her mothers juwellery box  the key belonged to her father. Its the same key she has been seeing in her dreams. For years she has the same dream she sees herself in a mirror with the key around her neck and then theres another boy. Shes obssessed with him. But if the key unlocks a hidden diary shes sucked into the past and there she meets the boy of her dreams  His name is Philip and hes from the Walker family (Windsor and Walker are rivals). He is the only one who can see Michele and they immediately fall in love. I know first I got some sort of Twilightfeeling but they are so sweet together. Theres a certain feeling between the two and I really believe that they are meant for eachother.  From now on Michele is a time traveller and sometimes she travels without wanting it.

Back in the normal time  2010  theres a new student. And when Michele looks at him her heart skipped a beat hes a duplicant of her Philip he has the same name and he wears the same ring.    I felt sad sometimes when its clear that they love eachother so much but they cant be together. And I think its nice that Philip learns to move on but at the same time I hated him for it.. He doesnt belong to anyone else than Michele But the ending made it all worth is because a time travel relationship is not the best to have. I want to know how this story continues Michele is a very likeable person and Philip sounds so nice. Im excited for the new book. Its called Timekeeper and it will be released in december this year. And I want to know the whole story about her father.;Alexandra Monir

This book has Mel written all over it D  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Guys this book was awesome Its cute its fun and the writingstyle reads so fast. The different twists and turns made it exciting and I love all the characters in this book. This book is one that makes you feel good after you finish it. I do think this one comes close to being a MG but that never bothered me.  This book is all about Kyra potions master and best friend of princess Ariana until she tries to murder her. After her failed attempt Kyra flees and asks help from a criminal. That is how she gets a pet a little pig. Ariana has disappeared and Kira is trying to find her to finish her job. On her way she meets Fred and she cant seem to get rid of him.  This book is great because it has so many strong points. The first thing is the easy writingstyle. The sentences flow and everything breathes the magical feeling of a fairytale. There is a nice pacing and a very interesting plot. This isnt just a shallow story. We are thrown into Kyras life and piece by piece we unravel her decision to kill her best friend. I loved the mystery and all the twist. When I finally had the feeling I knew everything Zinn took another turn. She managed to surprise me with her clever ways to make it exciting and thrilling.  And what about the cast Kyra is brave and incredibly easy to connect with. She is intelligent and I love her way of fighting the use of her selfcreated poisons. She tries to be strong but we get glimpses of her soft side. It was fun to see her change around Fred. What I liked is that there is more to her than you would expect  it all becomes very clear at the end. FRED This boy captured my heart from the beginning. His humor and charming behavior make him totally swoon worthy. Its not strange that Kyra slowly starts to fall for him ( add his attractive appearance. I do love the fact that she described him as pretty but not in a perfect way) There is also Ariana who has a great sense of humor as well. She seems like the perfect friend and she is a lot of spunk for a princess. And I cant complete this review without mentioning Rosie the little pig. She is adorable  Another thing that definitely adds bonus points is the fact that there is no instalove. Kyra and Fred spend some time together and yes they are attracted to each other but they never speak of love instead they talk about liking each other. Awesome They are so cute together.  What makes me sad is the fact that the author died of cancer in May 2011. Shell never be able to see her success and well never get to meet Kyra Fred and Rosie again.;Bridget Zinn

How sweet is thatHe tries to convince Sophie to keep her powers. He wants her to be able to defend herself and he will learn her tricks he used for years.

301;8428195;5;236117;0062001035;Just when Azalea should feel that everything is before herbeautiful gowns dashing suitors balls filled with dancingits taken away. All of it. And Azalea is trapped. The Keeper understands. Hes trapped too held for centuries within the walls of the palace. So he extends an invitation.Every night Azalea and her eleven sisters may step through the enchanted passage in their room to dance in his silver forest but there is a cost. The Keeper likes to keepthings. Azalea may not realize how tangled she is in his web until it is too late.;472;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1279037245m8428195.jpg;Entwined;fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com...  I LOVED this book about Azalea the main character and the crown princess followed by all her sisters Bramble Clover Delphinium Evening Primrose (Eve) Flora Goldenrod Hollyhock Ivy Jessamine Kale and newborn Lily. They are all named after flowers and plants  which I thought was very funny  but it also shows how the king lives. He likes structure and therefore there are rules everybody must obey.  The books starts with Azalea getting redding for the ball. She has finally reached the age and she has arranged most of the things since her mother is very sick. We immediately find out that dancing is very important for her (and her sisters). I love how that reflects the title Entwined because that is a dance. What I like is that we get to meet the princesses  they all have their own personality  and we can see how the story unravels. We now get to know why the princesses want to dance each night and how they found the enchanted forest. When their mother passes away after childbirth they go into mourning. That means that every curtain is closed there clothes must be black and they are no longer allowed to dance.  Their castle is enchanted. A long time ago their was an evil King who used his magic to capture souls in mirrors and he magicked a lot of stuff in the castle. He even made special routes in the walls and they find one by mistake in their bedroom. When they enter the enchanted forest they can dance and no one knows. The man in charge of the forest is called Keeper. He is mysterious and has something dark. He invites them to come dance every night and the princesses are thrilled by it but the King starts to notice. First he finds out that their slippers are worned out. When he throws them away they dance in their boots and they dance until their feet hurts too much. He decides to give them new slippers and a shoemaker who can make them every time they are worn out. That shows the true personality of the King. He is harsh and the princesses really hate him during the book but he is just a little stiff. He loves them and the wants to find out their secret. He asks every gentleman to find out their secret. Instead of putting them to death like the real story he just sents them away if they dont succeed after three days. That way we get to meet several young men and I appreciated Lord Teddy and Mr. Bradford. Lord Teddy is just so silly and adorable. He made me laugh and I loved meeting him. Mr. Bradford sounds like a lovely nice man.  The story gets a dark twist when Azalea finds out who Mr. Keeper really is. Hes there for a reason and hell do anything to reach his goal. Azalea must act quick or she may loose everything she loves.  This book has one big strenght the lovely adorable characters. The way Heather portraited every one of them as an own identity is marvelous. Clover is the shy one Bramble has a big mouth Azalea is responsible Eve is the bookwurm the King looks a bit mean and harsh but he has a sweet inside and so on. The love in this book develops and grows. Every element in it is right and Im a sucker for happily ever afters.  I think this is a clever nice retelling of the real story. I think I even like this one more than the original one. Its also a good thing that this story gets a retelling most of the time we only get retellings of popular ones. Its one of my favorite now and Im looking forward reading more of Heather.  If you love fairytales like me Read this one.  If you dont love fairytales Still read this one;Heather Dixon

But most of all Annah would like to forget the day Elias left her.;384;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1279843641m8455335.jpg;The Dark and Hollow Places (The Forest of Hands and Teeth 3);youngadult;Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Let me say that this was a dark book filled with despair and broken characters. I loved it Yes sometimes it felt depressing but lets face it the world these characters live in isnt a happy place. Zombies Mudos Unconsecrated Plague rats call them what you want are ruling the world. Its not a pretty picture. If you scroll to the end of this post you can find a spoiler free conclusion about this book.  Its one thing to know a truth in your head but another to understand it in your heart.  Spoilerish version.  Anna lives in The Dark City. The place where she went to with Elias after abandoning her sister Abigail in The forest of hands and teeth. She is scared that Elias is dead so she wants to leave the city. She has no easy life. She must fight and struggle to survive especially since The Recruiters are becoming violent and unfair.  Thats when Catcher and GabryAbigail arrive. There is a lot of fuss and they capture Gabry. When Annah tries to save Gabry she is attacked by a group of men and Catcher saves her life. They flee into the tunnels under the city.  It appears that they took Gabry to the island called The sanctuary There is no way to get on the island without a good trade. Thats where Elias comes into the picture. He made a trade they get Gabry back if he turns Catcher in. Hes immune and they want to use him for supplies. That will come in handy since the horde arrived. This part of the book was so scary. Zombies burst through the walls and they flood the city like water until the city is one big crawling mass of bodies. They are lucky that they can escape to the sanctuary. Not that its very safe there. The Recruiters are nasty mean people. Ox the leader will do anything to please his men to keep order.  You dont deserve the air you breathe you dirty plague bag and I hope you all die deaths as ugly as you are And even though my mouth is dry I spit at him as best as I can.  Annah and Gabry are trying to come up with a plan to leave the island. Catcher is exhausted so he is desperate to find a way out. He makes a lot of trips to the city to get supplies. Thats how they make their final plan. Catcher found a ship on the shore. Annah comes with the idea of making a hot air balloon with Gabrys fabrics. It works in the beginning. Annah Gabry and Elias are half way when the balloon is dropping. Thats when Annah decides that she must sacrifice herself. She left her sister behind once and she wants to make up for it so she jumps out of the balloon.  With the Recruiters and zombies behind her back she tries to find a way into the tunnels. She manages to find one and thats when another scary part begins. I kept reading because I wanted to find out if Annah would make it. Will she find a way to get to the ship or will she fall into the hands of the zombies If you want to find out youd better pick this one up. Its worth it I promise you  (Spoiler free) conclusion.  Fastpaced tense writing. Wonderful characters. I loved how brave and vulnerable Annah was at the same time. I could identify with her insecurity. She survived a lot of things and I dont think I would be able to do the same thing. Her love interest with Catcher was believable. They really grew toward each other and they were so cute together  Dark and scary like a zombie book is supposed to be. There are a lot of anxious moments in which Carrie doesnt spare her characters. Even in the end there is a lot of action and zombies. Awesome  This last book was a nice ending to a great trilogy although Im sad that this is the last one. Im not ready to leave them behind There is still one big question left but it doesnt annoy me that much. It just makes me wonder about the world and what is going to happen to them.  I really liked the details the descriptions made this book vivid and real for me.  Definitely recommended to zombielovers If you dont like them yet maybe this is the time to discover your love for them. This was my first zombie series and I totally fell in love with them so perhaps the same thing will happen to you );Carrie Ryan

The first time I read Daughter of smoke and bone I gave it 3.5 flowers. I had trouble with the beginning of the book and I wasnt blown away. When I bought the sequels I decided to reread the book and I was surprised I liked it so much more I was sucked into the story right away. For some reason the story worked better the second time so I ended up giving it 4 flowers now.  The sequels continued to stun me. Laini has a way with words and its easy to get lost inside her tale. She spins a story in front of you and before you know it you are hooked inside it. The story grows dark in Days of blood and starlight and continues to be more gruesome in Dreams of Gods and Monsters. I absolutely loved it and I like how she managed to make the books enjoyable instead of being too dark or depressing. Her worldbuilding is excellent. Laini found the perfect balance there is enough details to make it vivid but not so much that there are infodumps.  Daughter of smoke and bone could be seen as a very good setup because thats when we learn about Karous background. It was interesting to find out what was going on and who she really is. Her friendship with Zuzana was adorable and its good to see that the girl plays a constant important role in her life. She isnt swept away when the plot kicks in. Laini managed to write her into the story in a subtle way making sure she is there when Karou needs her the most.  The romance between Akiva and Karou had a touch of instalove but its quite understandable when you know the whole story. However it wasnt my favorite aspect of the story. I loved Karou and her feisty intelligent personality. I wasnt a huge fan of Akiva for some reason. He always felt a little flat to me and I didnt feel connected to him. I did warm up to him in the sequel  my favorite part of the series. Days of blood and starlight was amazing and I had to give it 5 flowers. Karou takes an important role in the upcoming war between the two different camps. We get to see glimpses of Karous past and are introduced to new characters like the White Wolf Ziri and the nasty Jael. Ziri was adorable and stole my heart right away. Jael was creepy and provides an interesting bad guy.  The war breaks loose in Dreams of Gods and monsters. Its a battle with many consequences and its fascinating to see how old enemies unite against a common enemy. There is also a new problem coming up someone is hunting down Akiva. All these threats make the story intense and fastpaced. I was constantly turning pages wanting more. The other two books ended with crazy cliffhangers but this book has a spectacular perfect ending. I couldnt have wished for more.  Laini has found her way to my list of favorite authors and I look forward to her new books.;Laini Taylor

After really enjoying part two I decided to pick this one up. You can see that I was disappointed by this story.  The first thing that really surprised me is the amount of sex scenes. Dont get me wrong I dont mind it but I didnt expect them in a fairytale retelling. They felt very out of place and this book lost all its magical charm. Most of the time our MC can be found in the bed of several men in an attempt to forget her real love William. He is send away to a monastery because his father isnt able to take care of William and his two sisters. Tia is a plain dull looking girl as her mother likes to describe her. William is the only one who gives her the attention she longs for. They are making love two weeks long before he leaves and they start to fall in love. Tia is now a pariah and that is when she throws herself at any available man. I think she feels flattered when she seduces them but she lost her dignity in my eyes.  I did admire Tias strength. She stood up for herself and she doesnt care about other peoples opinion. That is the only good thing I can say about her though. I didnt care for William. I never felt a connection with these characters  and that is not only because of the shortness of this story. The writingstyle made them feel very distant.  There is still a moment when we get a glimpse of a fairytale. When a little girl Rose comes in their town with her two aunties. It appears that Rose is simple but she is in fact princess Aurora. When the evil fairy cast her curse the last good faerie couldnt complete the Sevenfold spell. Rose is doomed to stay this way until she sleeps for a hundred years.

This is a retelling of the twelve dancing princesses mixed with the tale of Arthur and the round table. This was an unique twist and it worked.  Summary.  Rowena lives with her father and eleven sisters in a house surrounded by a high wall. Their mother disappeared when they were young girls. Their father is very protective. He doesnt want to lose his daughters so they arent allowed to go past the wall. What he doesnt know is that this wife is still very close locked away by magic.  One day Rowena found a hole in the wall and she slips outside. She meets the man she saw in her visions Bedivere and they fall in love. When her father discovers that he doubles the security. Luckily for the girls there is a secret passage in their room. It leads to a tunnel complex under their house. Every night they go dancing and their father is desperate  The man who can find their secret can marry a princess of his choice. The first man fails but the second one is Bedivere. He is also on another quest. He was one of the knights from Arthur but the King died in a fight he gave him Excalibur. Bedivere must throw the sword into an enchanted lake.  Can he rescue the princesses from an evil magic and can he complete his quest  Opinion.  There is not much character development and the love is the most instantlove you can get. Bedivere met Rowena in her visions so I guess they had a special connection. Its definitely a happilyeverafterstory.  Their mother has been captured and we also see how she is trying to break free from the spell. It must be frustrating to be so close to the people you love without being able to tell them. I love how these two different stories came together in the end.;Suzanne Weyn

I prefer long stories where I can bond with characters so this book surprised me Marissa did a great job in spinning stories with a fairytale feeling.  Where nightmares walk was strange. Its only 2 pages long and there is hardly anything to say about it. My expectations dropped down but Im happy to say that Winters kiss made me excited again. Its a fairytale about a girl whose breathe freezes everything around her. She cant find her place in this world until she is visited by an ice bear. This meeting is about to change her life. This was one of my favorite stories. Transition is a vampire story and it was a bit strange. It gave me a meh feeling. Love struck was great on the other hand. Its about a Selkie boy called Murrin who is trying to win the love of his true match Alana.  Old habits Cotton Candy Skies Stopping time and Unexpected family were hard to follow. These stories belong to the Wicked Lovely series and I couldnt understand it. I will return to this anthology after reading the series. The art of waiting was interesting you have to see it for yourself. Flesh for comfort was bizarre in a good way It gave me the creeps. The sleeping girl and the Summer king was my other favorite story. Its about a girl who gets to choose living forever with the Summer King or ruling the Winter. Fairytale feeling Merely Mortal was sweet about the love between the Winter queen and a fairy who became mortal after saving her life.  This book was definitely enjoyable and I think Im going to take a look at her series. Her writingstyle was pleasant enough.;Melissa Marr

I think I enjoyed this book more than the first one because there were so many things going on. Evie is finally leading her normal life (especially because the agency thinks she died) but shes not really satisfied. She wants more. So when shes contacted to get some missions she makes up her mind and decides to do it. That gives some tension between her and Lend he hates the agency for what they did to him an all the other people.  But things have changed. Theyre hunting the bad guys and they treat the right guys good. They even stopped using fairies all the time because theres Jack. He grew up in the fairy world and his has trained himself to use the same doors as the fairies do. But.. he keeps showing up and it gives Evie a hard time. Her relationship with Lend is really on the edge and when they fight everything comes out and she leaves with Jack.  But things are not going as planned..  Evie is more mature (eventhough shes still into pink a color I actually quite dislike) and she really stands up for herself. I love the fact that shes hard but still kind and loving. And I like Arianne the depressed and funny vampire.;Kiersten White

Why dont you take first watch prince You could actually be doing something that doesnt make me want to gouge my eyes out with a spork.  This is my favorite book from The Iron Fey so far. Ash and Meghan are banned from the faery world but Meghan isnt planning on staying away. After an attack from The Iron Fey in her mortal world she decides to take things into her own hands. First she must do a couple of things to get her father back from Leanansidhe. The exiled queen gives them a safe place to stay.  Meghan finds out that Puck knew about her father and she is really angry with him. She even sends him away but soon its time to ask him for help. It appears that her magic is struggling she has the Iron and Summer power and they wont mix. Puck must help her to control it otherwise she cant use either of them.  One day they get a offer from the Summer and Winter court. If she defeats the new and fake Iron King their banishment is over. They cant turn it down but there comes the real problem. How the hell do they get to The Iron King and how can she defeat him She cant use her power and his realm is spreading fast which means that he is gaining a lot of power. I liked that our heroin really suffered in the end. Not that I enjoy that but it made it realistic. In real life you have to fight for it so I like that she had a tough battle.  Opinion.  First of all I loved the romance in this book Since their relationship is developing it feels so.. real. I tend to like Puck more but I get her feelings for Ash he does sound handsome and he is incredibly sweet for her. I had to include this quote  Ash brushed the hair from my neck and leaned close to my ear his voice so soft not even Grimalkin couldve heard it. I love you he murmured and my heart nearly burst out of my chest. Whatever happens were together now.  Normally I dont really like all the swoony quotes but I found myself going all warm inside when I read this book. Of course there is Puck and our lovely sarcastic cat Grimalkin. Those two really make my day. I could be friends with them without a doubt. They complete the story.  There is also enough action in this book. Its not all butterflies and rainbows because the world is changing  fast. The realm of the Iron Fey is spreading and a lot of land and faeries died in the war. Its up to Meghan to safe the world she begins to love and its a dangerous mission. Enough fighting and scary creatures to make it a fastpaced story. I really liked this one.;Julie Kagawa

I liked Paranormalcy  Supernaturally and this is the perfect conclusion.

That is until Lend is kidnapped by The Dark Faerie Queen from the Unseelie court. Evie decides to accept Reths and Jacks help to get him back. In the mean time Paranormals are asking her to open a gate for them. They want to return to their own world. Can Evie save Lend and is the ready to make a gate  Evie was a good character but I liked her more in Paranormalcy. She was a bit more whiny now always busy with her and Lend. She was completely focused on saving him but she was ignorant for other problems. Her mood swings were annoying too. She hates Reth then she likes him then she hates him so much she likes him  make up your mind  So conclusion a good ending for this series but nothing too special.;Kiersten White

This is where Fire lives a girl whose beauty is impossibly irresistible and who can control the minds of everyone around her. Exquisitely romantic this companion to the highly praised Graceling has an entirely new cast of characters save for one person who plays a pivotal role in both books.

This is such a powerful story about a broken girl who starts to discover her own possibilities. I loved seeing Fire grow and how she begins to accept herself. Sometimes it was on the line of becoming whining but at the same time its not strange she had such a hard time.  Fire is the child of a human monster (father) and human (mother) which makes her one too. They have exceptional beauty and they are gifted with the capability of controlling minds. Her father reveled in his power over others and it made him cruel. He drove the first king of Dell Nax into madness and his son Nash is now trying to fix the chaos. His kingdom is falling apart and several rebels are trying to claim the throne. Nash only loyal subject is his brother Brigan who is the commander of his army. Fire is living with Archer and his father in a house hidden in the forest. She is afraid of her power and tries to use it as little as possible afraid she might turn into her father but Nash needs her power to unravel all his enemies.  I liked that the story starts with Immiker a boy Graced with the gift of mindcontrol who later turns out to be King Lech. You might recognize his name from Graceling. He later returns in this storyline and it was a fun way to make a connection with the first book.  I loved Fire right away. Yes she often complaints about how unfair it is that she is so beautiful but at the same time she must hide herself because every male who lays his eye on her wants to claim her. It made her feel unappreciated for her other features like her intelligence and loving heart. Fire is also feisty and brave which made me really appreciate her. Some of the attack situations made me feel a little uncomfortable but at the same time I applaud Cashore for the way she handles it.  The only thing that can save Fire from the results of her extreme beauty is her gift but she doesnt like to use it often. It was amazing to see how she blooms when she is brought to court under the watching eye of Brigan  who is unaffected by her. She starts to realizes that her gift can be used for good things and she wants to help Nash whenever she can. I always like it when characters develop in such a way and it gave a good base for the growing affection between her and Brigan.  And because you are neither my husband nor my father I am a woman of seventeen I have my own horses and my own money and I decide for myself where I go and when. This is not yours to forbid.  The plot is interesting. Its about a mysterious archer she must tries to identify. He leaves a trail of dead men and Nash must know what is going on. There is also a pact between his two main enemies and they must find out what they are up to before it is too late. The pacing was perfect and I flew through the pages. At the end I still wasnt ready to leave Fire but the story is nicely wrappedup (and I can already tell you that the conclusion to this series Bitterblue is very good too).;Kristin Cashore

Im not sure about the rating yet.  edit 2.5 it is. Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  You can see that I have some bad luck with fairytales lately but this one was definitely not THAT bad. The low rating is based on the fact that there were too many unbelievable lucky situations and I didnt connect with the characters.  Cinderella lives with the witch and her two daughters Agatha  Gwendolyn after the death of her father. She has one friend a cat called Max. She is trapped in her house forced to do all the chores without any appreciation for her hard work. Cinderella did inherited some magic from her deceased mother and she is practicing it every day  together with her Ninja skills. I wished these skills were better explored but they didnt add anything to the story in my opinion.  One day Ty (a royal messenger) invites them all for the special ball. The prince is going to pick one lucky girl to marry him. It is from the beginning very clear who Ty is and I didnt get the chemistry between Ty and Cinderella. Most scenes were actually cringe worthy and the dialogues were hilarious. Ty is instantly flirting with Cinderella and he practically falls in love with her from the moment he sees her. Yeah very believable. If it only was that easy huh )  It is very easy to predict how this story is going to end so I will skip that. One thing I liked about this book was the fact you got to pick your own path. There are 8 routes you can take and it was fun to decided Cinderellas choices. I appreciated the original approach and the way the author created different storylines.  While my rating of 2.5 looks bad it wasnt such a horrible book. Its based on several little things I disliked and it wouldnt be honest to other books to give it more flowers.;Maureen McGowan

I kept reading until midnight because I wanted to know who the wolf was and then I found out that there was no ending Why the hell would you write a book and then post the ending on your website That costed the book one star. Today I read the ending and I just keep wondering why she did this.. s  We meet Valerie and her sister Lucie. Valerie feels that shes the bad sister. Lucie is beautiful nice to other people etc and she always feels less. But then her old friend Peter returns to the city and she falls in love with him right away. (Yes very believable.. I know him from years ago and I feel this way it must be the love everybody talks about. Or maybe youre just glad that hes back)  But theres trouble. The blood red moon (only then can the werewolf create another wolf) is back and the wolf is on the hunt. They get help from a guy who thinks hes a real werewolfhunter but hes a dick. I really liked the fact that they had to kill him because the wolf bit him. Her sister Lucie dies after an attack and Valerie wants revenge for it.  Everybody is a potential werewolf and I kept picking between several people but in the end I still got wrong.  SPOILER  Then Peter gets bitten by the werewolf and he promises Valerie that he will return if he manages to find a way to control the monster. Sad I liked him.  It wasnt not as good as I expected this book to be. Sometimes it lacked of action and Im not sure if I really liked Valerie. Theres something about her the way she whines about the fact that nobody loves her as much as they love Lucie that got on my nerves.;Sarah BlakleyCartwright David Leslie Johnson Catherine Hardwicke

It took me some time to get in the story but when we came to the part where Cas meets Anna I was completely hooked. I never thought that a YA book could be scary and bloody like this because I havent got much luck with YA horror books so far. But at the same time I dont think it was too scary. Someone who doesnt like ghost books is definitely capable of reading and enjoying this.  Meet Cas normal teenager boy slash ghosthunter. He travels with his mother around the world in his fathers footsteps. Together with his athame knife and his skills he takes care of the haunting ghosts. That is until he meets Anna the girl who was murdered in her school dress years ago. She is still hunting in a house and many teenagers died. Cas believes its a job like any other until he meets Anna. She doesnt rip him apart and he understands that something else is going on. Together with his new friends something that rarely happens Cas wants to find out what is the story behind Anna.  What I really liked is that this isnt just a ghost story. There is more depth to it when we find out what truly happened to Anna and why she is so conflicted about all the murders. I felt so sorry for her and I was hoping for Cas to find a solution. It doesnt take away that Anna is one scary girl. She can snap and change with the blink of an eye but her sweet side shows an admirable girl.  I liked Cas. I think Kendare did a great job on portraying a teenage boy. His voice sounded believable and I like how normal he seems despite his messedup life. Its also interesting that Kendare managed to take cliched characters and turned them into something more. Example Carmel. She is the typical queen bee pretty popular and smart. But Kendara turned her into something that felt realistic and she shows us that there is more to us than what we see the first time.  Then there is also the creepiness. There was one part in this book that frightened me. Im not going to tell you what it is but it has something to do with the way Cas father died. Let me just say that reading this before sleeping wasnt the best idea. I kept hearing strange sounds everywhere.. I cant wait to read the next book;Kendare Blake

This is a layer between heaven and hell where certain people found a way to be immortal The Everlivings. Every hundred years they must bring someone with them so they can suck out their emotions and energy in order to survive. These victims are called Forfeits. Most of them die after the Feed but the living are taken away in the Tunnels where they feed the whole Everneath with their energy. Nikki lives and she chooses to Return. She has six months before the Shadow in her opens the Tunnel to take her back. Her Everliving Cole follows her and tries to persuade her to return with him. He can make her his Queen and that will spare her of the horrible fate in the Tunnels.  But Nikki isnt planning to return with Cole. She is trying to get her life back but most of all she wants to see her boyfriend Jack. When they slowly get their friendship back Nikki decides to tell him everything. Jack believes her and together they are trying to find a way to defeat the Everneath.  First of all there is some sort of lovetriangle in this book but it worked for me. Cole really wants Nikki to be his Queen and he keeps stalking her. Nikki sometimes returns to him because he completes her. He took her emotions away and this gives a freaky and unwelcome bond between them. I liked how Nikki always tried to keep Cole away from her and the people she love. She isnt weak or whiny but strong. Than there is adorable Jack the boyfriend she still loves. All these three characters had their own distinct voice. I could connect with them and despite the fact that Cole is a bad boy I just couldnt hate him.  The worldbuilding was good. The information we get is spread throughout the book and that made it easy to understand the situation. In flashbacks we see how Jack and Nikkis relationship started and how sweet they were together. It was also nice to see how Nikki is trying to pick up her life. Its pretty messed up but her father is trying to make the best out of this situation and her little brother is cute.  The mythology was nicely incorporated into the storyline and the writingstyle was great. I flew through the pages and the plot kept me hooked to the pages. You can predict the ending but it didnt spoil the fun for me. It only makes me excited to read the next book. I cant wait  Remembering is easy. Its forgetting thats hard.;Brodi Ashton

There was a twist I never expected and it made this book blend into the first book perfectly. I wondered how this series would stick together and Pearce definitely made it work. I loved the little interview at the end of the book where Gretchen and Rosie meet each other.  Thats what love is. It becomes a part of you. It holds you down sometimes it becomes something you cant escape.  Summary.  Ansel and Gretchen are cast out by their stepmother. On their way to their new life their car breaks down and they dont have enough money to get it fixed. They end up in a little pub where everybody eyes them with suspicion. Its clear they arent used to newbies but one of the guys offers them a job. Sophia who lives on the edge of Live Oak works in a candy store and she can use some help. They accept it right away.  Sophia is mysterious. Its a pretty girl and she appears to be very happy but there are some dark memories haunting her life. Like Gretchen and Ansel she lost her sister. Gretchens twin was snatched away in the woods by a witch. Sophias father was slaughtered by a beast and the whole town distrust her. Ever year she gives a chocolate party and every time a girl goes missing.  One day Gretchen stands facetoface with her enemy. The socalled witch appears to be something else and she is saved by Samuel he is Silas brother from Sisters Red. She wants him to teach her how to fight and strangely he accepts. The village thinks he is crazy a lunatic but Gretchen her feelings are telling her very different things.  Can Gretchen unravel Sophias secrets before it is too late for her and the other girls  Opinion.  It was a fantastic read. There isnt much action and it was slow but in a good way. There was enough time to bond with the characters to get absorbed by the atmosphere. Sophia is a strange girl and I felt suspicious from the beginning. Ansel starts to fall in love with her and Gretchen likes her but she keeps her mind clear. She is capable of making intelligent choices and she was such a kick ass girl. Instead of shying away from her fears she looks them in the eyes. Samuel was lovely. He is a bit distant but that made him more attractive for me. I like how their feelings really develop.  The story knew how to surprise me from the beginning to the end. Even in the last couple of pages there was an unexpected twist. The writing style reads incredibly fast you keep running through the pages until the last word hits you in the face. I definitely cant wait to get my hands on Fathomless so I can devour that one too.;Jackson Pearce

My love for covers did it again tricking me into reading a book but its a shame that I liked the cover more than the inside.  Sixteenyearold Kate moves from Brooklyn to Paris after her parents dead. She and her sister Georgia leave America tolive with their fathers parents two very sweet characters. Kate is depressed and fills her days with watching movies haunting museums and staring at the ceiling. She lies to her friends when she mails them back and she declines every offer from her sister to join her and her friends. Thats how Georgia deals with the loss of her parents  Its not you who is dead she said. Mom and dad are and they would want you to live.  Kate decides to go to a cafe to read a book  something I liked about her  when she notices a very handsome boy. After meeting him again she cant stop thinking about him. Yes there comes the instant love. A gorgeous face is all it takes. This boy called Vincent keeps popping up everywhere Kate is. When she finally has the chance to talk to him he asks her out. At some point he acts really strange and thats when they stop seeing each other for a long time. When Kate discovers something that she doesnt understand she visits him at his house and things only get more complicated.  Vincent is not just a pretty boy no he is a Revenant. He dies to save the life of others but there are also the Numa a group of people who take lives in order to have their immunity. There is a battle going on between them and Kate is about to find out what it means to have an undead boyfriend with an enemy.  Things I liked.  Jules. He is one of the Revenants and he is so funny. He is a real womanizer and I liked him from the first moment I met him.  The setting. You know in real life I dont like Paris. At all. But there is something magical about the Paris in books.  The Revenants. I thought it was quite original. They are some sort of zombies without all the craving for human flesh.  Georgia. She is the opposite of me in most of the things she does so I think that is was I liked about her. She has a lot of friends she is easy with new people she has connections everywhere and she is really protective towards Kate.  Things I didnt liked.  When you think about the story its actually pretty boring. Its all about Kates love for Vincent even when she pushes him away and her sadness because of her parents dead. There is only some real story in the end of the book but that wasnt enough to get me really entertained.  The way everything seems to go perfect. Kate falls in love with Vincent right away and of course he is attracted to her too. When Vincent takes over in Kates body (when his body is down in hibernation his spirit is free to move out of the body) everything ends well while most people would become crazy. Their brains cant handle it but Kate is one of a kind.. Yeah right. And she can hear his voice when he is in his ghost appearance and thats super rare.  Opinion.  Kate was alright. The story was a bit too boring for me but I will give the next one a try because I heard so many great things about it.;Amy Plum

I guess this book just didnt work for me. This is an active fiction title and according to Goodreads Active fiction is a new type of ereading experience that allows the reader and the author to interact with each other and the text in new and different ways. In Witchs Brew Lily and Logans fate is already decided but Heidi explores several different possible pathways for how they get there. She shares scenes that wouldnt normally fit in a book format and gives readers more precious moments between the two young lovers. As the series progresses youll see some normal narrative forms interspersed with smaller scenes alternate points of view and a lot of what if scenarios.  It sounded like fun to me but I didnt like it. Despite the fact that there are only 2 what if scenarios it was too chaotic for my taste. The two paths were quite similar so I had the idea that I was reading the same thing twice  with just a little twist. It made it a bit harder to follow the real story and there were also some flaws.  This story tells about the 16yearold Lily. She is Leader of the Daughters of light a witch coven. They are training for their first Gleaning. This is a special battle that takes place on the same date every year. They will be fighting against wizards this time lead by Logan. When the two of them meet  something that is strict forbidden  things are starting to change. He might be the one from the Prophecy and Lily must do everything to find out if he bears the mark. If he is the one he can safe all of them. Years ago the Sisters punished the witch community with a curse. Women wanted to live amongst humans while the men wanted to rule with their magic. The females got eternal youth and beauty forcing the warlocks to desire what they couldnt have. The witches were forced to watch their magical equals wither away before their eyes without ever knowing love. The Gleaning is there so they can fill up the hole in their magic but the end is coming. If the curse doesnt get broken this year their powers will fade away entirely.  I must admit this concept sounds great doesnt it Unfortunately I didnt like the execution. The writingstyle is very choppy and felt unnatural. The dialogues were a bit boring and short. I felt like this story was meant for a younger audience because of the easy choice of words. The characters were alright. They arent really memorable and I didnt like their instantconnection. I did like the plot but it took a long time before we got there. The story ended very abrupt. Like someone ripped out the last pages (in my case deleted them from my ecopy).  One thing that also annoyed me was the fact that there is a constant switch between Logan and Lilys POV. It didnt add anything to the story in my opinion. Thats why Im wondering if I should continue or not because I do want to know more about The Gleaning.  Overall great promise but disappointing.;Heidi R. Kling

They just ate their last food. Their grandfather is in the fridge because he died a couple of days ago. They havent showered for months and father and mother always fight.  These are the conditions Sherry lives in together with her family.  1139 days since Id seen daylight.  Only 2 minutes since wed run out of food.  Thats when her father decides its enough. They are locked because of the rabies. It should not take so long the government promised to deal with the problem within a couple of weeks. They also promised to tell them when it was safe. There is still no news so her father wants to go and find food. Sherry wants to join him.  The world outside is not a pretty picture. The city looks horrible and there is not a soul on the street. Almost every bunker they find is empty. What happened while they were in their bunker It seemed like there were bombs but why would the government do such a thing No time to wonder for answers. They must find food and they come across a store. Thats when the story really begin.  They are attacked by two rabies and Sherry can escape but when she returns there is no sight of her father and she is saved by a boy called Joshua. He takes her to a special place where he survives with other people like Geoffrey the scientist. He tells her something shocking something shed never suspected but there is no time to stand still by these new facts. Sherry must safe her father from The weepers and she must return to get her other family members. Will she make it in time or is everything lost  I really like the story and the way it went towards the end. Perhaps its just me but I never saw that coming I was stunned by the climax of this story and that made this book very powerful.  Things I liked.  The fact that the story reveals itself piece by piece. The story builds up towards the end and you dont get disappointed when you finally find out whats going on. The climax was amazing.  Sherry I really liked this girl. She is determined to find and safe her father. She doesnt develops a lot in the story but she was a nice character.  The writing style was easy flowing and fastpaced. I liked the constant tension of the rabies. Especially the part when they breach into their Safe Haven.  The Rabies or as they call them The weepers. The fact that they are intelligent is so scary They arent just craving for flesh they still use their mind.  Things I disliked.  The little lines saying how many days she didnt see this or didnt ate that. In the beginning I felt like it was effective to show how many days she was locked under the ground. After that it became a bit annoying.  The love interest. I couldnt understand Sherrys feelings toward the guy. He never showed the same interest in her. Better yet he was rude sometimes. And suddenly they had some kind of relationship.  Conclusion.  I think that this book is highly recommendable. I enjoyed myself during the reading and some parts were really tense and scary. Yes this story is not perfect. There are a couple of flaws but it was good enough to help me forget those little mistakes. And that is what reading is all about isnt it ) simply enjoying a story.;Susanne Winnacker

I tried to stay away from fangirling and swooning as much as I could but Duval sigh I adore him These are the kind of books that make me think why did I wait so long This book is filled with awesomeness and I was completely hooked to Ismaes story. I mean assassin nuns. I love it  Ismae wears the sign of Death on her body. Her mother tried to lose her from her womb with poison but Ismae survived. She grew up under hard circumstances. Her father was abusive and he married her off to another horrible man. When he sees the scar on her back he is horrified by her and he wants to have her executed. Ismae is rescued by the priest who married her and he ships her off to the convent of St. Mortain the patron Saint of Death. Here Ismae becomes one of the handmaidens of Death and her gift is poison.  After years of practice Ismae is assigned to her first task and that is how she meets Gavriel Duval. I love this guy. He is definitely swoonworthy. He is not the perfectprettyguy but thats what I liked about him. He is real because of his flaws and he sounds super attractive. The scenes between him and Ismae were filled with sexy tension. She is afraid in the beginning but slowly she starts to see that he is a good and loyal guy.  Duval is the bastard son of the duke and the French whore. That makes him the halfbrother of the new Duchess Anne. This girl is in serious trouble. The French are on the borders waiting to take over Brittain and several man are asking for her hand. She must make a decision soon or everything is lost. Ismae must keep an eye on Duval for the convent because they think he is a traitor. They are afraid that he wants to take the duchy for himself. When Ismae starts to unravel the real identity of the traitor she decides to act against the convent. She is starting to understand that she can use her gift in other ways and it might be time to leave the convent behind.  This girl is perfect. She is everything I could ask for in a main character. She is smart strong and feisty. A real kickass girl and I admire her strength physically and mentally. There is also the amazing Duval and some other great secondary characters like Beast. The character development is good. Ismae goes from blind trust in her convent to making her own decisions by using her head. The feelings between Duval and Ismae are sweet and there is enough time to develop. The worldbuilding is good. There is a lot of history and politics in this story but I wasnt bored at all. The writingstyle was so addictive and I cant wait for the next book. I need it now  Not all men are the same you know. with someone such as Gavriel I would suggest appearing aloof not chasing too much. He might see that as suffocating rather than charming. Her words are sharp but her voice is sweet like honey on the edge of a blade and meant to be cutting. I comfort myself with the knowledge that if Duval ever feels smothered by me it will be because I am holding a pillow over his face and commending his soul to Mortain.;Robin LaFevers

I enjoyed this book but there were a couple of things that bothered me and their solutions were too easy and effortless. Most of my reservations are based on the romance and the fact that Reveka felt too young for the loveinterest.  Reveka is the new herbalists apprentice together with her friend Didina. She is trying to find a way to break the curse on the twelve princesses. Every morning they are tired and their shoes are in tatters. The unfortunate soul who stayed the previous night in their room ends up in a state between life and death. Their bodies are collected in the infirmary waiting for the curse to be lifted before its too late. Reveka isnt so worried about them in the beginning shes in it for money.  I liked Reveka but I was a bit confused about her age. Sure sometimes she acts like a thirteen year old girl but most of the times she felt older to me. I think it would have been better if the author made her around sixteen (I just imaged she was that age to make it more believable.) She is clever and I like her persistence to break the curse even when her father keeps telling her its of no use. Some of her choices also showed how much she cares about others and her loyalty towards them. I can always appreciate that in a character.  Her relationship with her father was on a bumpy road but I liked his influence in her life. Its easy to see he doesnt know what to do with a daughter but thats not strange because he was a soldier for most of her life. While he was fighting in the war she grew up with her mother who died not too long ago. His new role as father falls hard on him but his attempts made me smile and in the end he cares about her and thats all that matters.  The mix of mythology and fairytales was interesting. I already knew I was in for some Beauty and the beast but I didnt know something similar to Hades and Persephone would make its entrance in the story. It was a nice blend and I would have enjoyed this part of the story so much more if Reveka was older  or he a bit younger. Her romance with her loveinterest felt a bit creepy now and the solution was almost a cheap way out. That being said I did like the loveinterest as a character. Hes exactly like the Beast a bit harsh in the beginning but slowly you understand his reasons behind every decision and you warm up to him.  Is it one of my favorite retellings No. Do I recommend it Yes. Its cute and easy. Nothing too special or unique but it gave me a satisfying smile and I enjoyed Revekas journey to a happilyeverafter she never imagined.;Merrie Haskell
330;9591398;4;236117;0312649614;Twelveyearold September lives in Omaha and used to have an ordinary life until her father went to war and her mother went to work. One day September is met at her kitchen window by a Green Wind (taking the form of a gentleman in a green jacket) who invites her on an adventure implying that her help is needed in Fairyland. The new Marquess is unpredictable and fickle and also not much older than September. Only September can retrieve a talisman the Marquess wants from the enchanted woods and if she doesnt . . . then the Marquess will make life impossible for the inhabitants of Fairyland. September is already making new friends including a bookloving Wyvern and a mysterious boy named Saturday. With exquisite illustrations by acclaimed artist Ana Juan Fairyland lives up to the sensation it created when the author first posted it online. For readers of all ages who love the charm of Alice in Wonderlandand the soul of The Golden Compass here is a reading experience unto itself unforgettable and so very beautiful.;247;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making (Fairyland 1);fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This was such an unique book It has a whimsical writingstyle one Ive never seen before. The cover is gorgeous and there are adorable illustrations at the beginning of every chapter. Its a magical tale filled with adventure and interesting characters.  It definitely took a while to get used to the writingstyle. The sentences are long and filled with details. Catherynne has a special choice of words and it gives this book a fairytaleesque feeling. I dont think this is something everyone will like but if you give this book some time Im sure you will be wrapped into the story. Here is an example  One ought not to judge her all children are Heartless. They have not grown a heart yet which is why they can climb high trees and say shocking things and leap so very high grownup hearts flutter in terror. Hearts weigh quite a lot. That is why it takes so long to grow one. But as in their reading and arithmetic and drawing different children proceed at different speeds. (It is well known that reading quickens the growth of a heart like nothing else.) Some small ones are terrible and fey Utterly Heartless. Some are dear and sweet and Hardly Heartless At All. September stood very generally in the middle on the day the Green Wind took her Somewhat Heartless and Somewhat Grown.  It surprised me that this book is targeted as MG because I think its a little difficult for younger children to read such a book. Perhaps read it together with them because its quite a challenge if you let them have this adventure on their own.  The story is filled with all these magical creatures in a fun setting Fairyland. There is a Wyvern who is one of Septembers new best friends there is a golem made out of soap and witches. They are all fleshed out and make a colorful cast. The funny thing is that my favourite character isnt September. Yes she is a wonderful young girl who is ready for adventure. She is brave and a clever little girl but the Wyvern AthroughL stole the spotlight for me. I think its because of his passion for words There is also a good villain present. The Marquess provides an interesting story and I liked her background. Villains with depth are always more interesting than plain evil ones.  I very much look forward to more adventures from September in Fairyland because her one time visit has turned out into something more.;Catherynne M. Valente Ana Juan

If you want to read the complete one follow this link  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book was frustrating. I feel like an outsider with this series because honestly I dont get the whole hype. Delirium was disappointing and this book was better but still not mindblowing. I guess this is just a case of its me not you. If you want to read this series and havent read Delirium I suggest you skip the review.  Let me get started with the things I liked because there were definitely some good about this book. I liked how it was separated in two parts. Every chapter switches between then and now giving us an interesting view on Lenas new world.  ..............  Another thing I liked was Raven. She is the leader of the resistance group and I admired her courage and strength. Its not strange that people follow her orders and trust her. I wish we got to see more of her because that brings me to the things I didnt like. Lena.  Oh boy this girl knows how to get on my nerves. She is the complete opposite of Raven. She whines complaints about every thing and her feelings drove me nuts. One moment she is crying over Alex the other moment I see her drooling all over Julian.  .........  Ive read many people saying how much they like her writingstyle but I dont see it. Im sorry but its just simple and nothing special to me.. I liked it and it was a fast read but its not any better than the average book. The ending also bugged me. It was just too predictable and it made me role my eyes. Of course there had to be a lovetriangle and I just wished authors were strong enough to keep their characters dead when necessarily.;Lauren Oliver

This book is so unsatisfying it makes me want to rip my hair out. Its Rise all over again. What is up with all these horrible open endings The first thing I thought and I wrote this down on Goodreads wait What Where the hell is the ending  Crap. That is still the best way to describe this book. Keep in mind that there are spoilers if you havent read the other two books.  The dual POV was nice. I liked seeing the way of life through the eyes of a cured one and Hanna wasnt a bad character. Im not sure if her POV was needed but I certainly liked her more than Lena. We just dont seem to click but her annoyance was better to endure here.  If I had to summarize this book in a few words it would be Running staying flee fighting losing crying complaining and hormones. There is a lot of action in this book and it was fastpaced but nothing spectacular actually happens. Most of the story is about Lenas conflicted feelings between AlexJulian and I just wanted her to make up her mind. It was obvious that she was using Julian as a replacement because Alex turned her down. But after his whole Oh look at me I sacrificed myself like the Solomon story they finally come back together. Took you long enough I didnt care for both boys. I really liked Alex in Delirium but I hardly know him here. He is on the background and we dont get time to connect with him. Julian was okay but not the right match for Lena.  Now let me talk about that HORRIBLE ENDING. If you can call it that. Id rather say the failed attempt to put some closure to the story. You can see that it didnt work for me. It left a bad taste in my mouth. Its almost like she ended this book with another cliffhanger for the next one but now you know there is nothing to wait for. This is what you get and I hated it. I can understand that its hard to write a good ending. Everyone is waiting for it and reads towards it so I can see the pressure to deliver but this is not how I like to see it and it pretty much spoiled the series.  Its a shame but Im definitely going to read more books from Oliver. I believe she is a gifted author and I really liked her MG books Liesl  Po and The spindlers. I feel bad for disliking this series so much but I guess we cant all like the same.;Lauren Oliver

When he first makes the announcement online to his classmates Butter expects pity insults and possibly sheer indifference. What he gets are morbid cheerleaders rallying around his deadly plan. Yet as their dark encouragement grows it begins to feel a lot like popularity. And that feels good. But what happens when Butter reaches his suicide deadline Can he live with the fallout if he doesnt go through with his plansWith a deft hand E.J. Lange allows readers to identify with both the bullies and the bullied in this allconsuming look at one teens battle with himself.;294;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1330188575m9634267.jpg;Butter;youngadult;2.53 stars.  If you can stomach it youre invited to watch... as I eat myself to death.  Earc.  This was one of my WoW picks a long time ago and I was so glad when I got the allowed to read this one. Unfortunately Im still not sure if I liked it or not. It was just.. so strange. Thats what you can expect but it was even weirder. Also the promise from the blurb to identify with the bullies and the bullied is not true. I never had the feeling that I understood the bullies. They were just sick people but they never really bullied him. They ignored him.  Butter is an obese boy who is extremely lonely. One day he decides that its time to make a change. After seeing his name on the list most likely to die of a heartattack he is so mad that he starts a website called butters last meal.  Instead of changing his eating habits he wants to eat himself to death. I dont get it but I will come back later on that topic. His website becomes very popular. People are cheering for him. Some people dont think he has the guts to do it so there are a lot of bets. Its sick. Butter makes some kind of friends. They help him with his bucket list and they try to come up with a nice last meal. Everything in his life spins around the website and he is stuck. If he backs away from the plan he will lose the attention but if he continues with it he loses even more his life.  There is also Anna his crush. He is talking to her on the web under a fake identity. When he finally talks to her in real life he is beginning to understand that he messes up his life. Is there a way back  Opinion.  I could understand that Butter snapped at one moment. Being lonely and ignored all the time is hard. When Butter starts his website in a whim he doesnt know where it will lead him. In the beginning he likes the attention. People are noticing him as a person not just as that big guy but its also naive from him. He clearly gets all these friends because there is something exciting is going on. I think this is even lonelier.  He is tangled up in his website and he feels like there is no returning. The cheering is so morbid. How could you possible support such a thing To me its strange that nobody told their parents about it. They try to keep the website private by putting up a password but there are so much rumors going on How is it possible that not one teacher notices that something is wrong  Even his favorite teacher just called Professor is clearly blind. Butters sudden popularity doesnt ring a bell. His mother is too ignorant and I dont understand why she didnt handled his obesity before His father hardly talks to him  better yet totally ignores Butter. But there comes the part that makes me wonder the most why is Butter this way Why did he started to eat this much He describes his mother as a tiny frail woman and his father has a normal posture. I wished there was more explanation about this past. We only get to know that he eats way too much and that he has a lousy attitude. He doesnt want to change. Its clearly that he needs a good smack in the face  Its just hard for me to relate to him since he is so filled with self pity. When one of his friends lost a lot of weight the only thing he can think about is we were supposed to lose weight together. Then stop whining and do something about it He blames everybody around him for his own failures and I couldnt buy that. I can understand that he feels miserable but I cant feel any pity for someone who is too lazy to do anything about it. I dont want to sound harsh. Its clearly a difficult subject since obesity is in the news all the time and I know what it is if you feel like you dont fit in to feel alone.  The writing was good.The writer kept me fascinated and I wanted to find out what would happen to Butter. In a certain way he grew on me. I wish I could help him but if you werent interested in this book in the first place skip it because youre not going to like it.;Erin Jade Lange

But the tests he must face to earn these things are impossible. And along the way Ash learns something that changes everything. A truth that challenges his darkest beliefs and shows him that sometimes it takes more than courage to make the ultimate sacrifice.;400;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1375920888m9659607.jpg;The Iron Knight (The Iron Fey 4);fantasy paranormal;Review also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  You realize youve been duped by a fish I said watching the catfish grin at me before slipping into the dark waters lost from view. Puck shrugged.  Hey it was going to name one of its grandfish after me he said tossing the line into the water again. Thats one of my rules you know. I refuse to eat anything that names its kid after me.  In part 3 Ash left Meghan in her Iron Kingdom. He vowed that he would find a way to stay with her he must find a soul and become mortal. Therefore he must find Grimalkin with Puck and that takes a lot of time and effort. When they finally found the cat Grimalkin tells them that they will search for The seer. This was unexpected for me. I never thought that The seer would be that person but I liked it and it made sense. It also made me feel sad.  The seer tells Ash that he must find The testing grounds. There will be a Guard and he will test Ash. If he accomplish all the tests he will gain a soul. If not he will be doomed to stay there forever until he fades away.  The road is long and difficult with a lot of danger but they make it to The testing grounds. Its not easy for Ash. He is having a hard time. Will Ash succeed in the tests Will he proceed to get a soul or will he leave Meghan becoming a mortal isnt what he expected.  Opinion.  I have strange feelings at the moment. I really loved this book but its also the last one and I dont want to say goodbye  This book is written from Ash his POV and Im glad for it. I learned more about him and his feelings because sometimes he was a bit hard to read. He is a wonderful character. He made mistakes in the past but that made him even more realistic. He is so caring for Meghan. We also have the other great characters. Puck is there of course with all his humor to make the story a bit lighter. Grimalkin sarcastic as always and a newbie The big bad wolf. He always fights with Grimalkin but they are like Puck and Ash. Deep down they are friends.  The tests were great I liked how he had to go through different stages of mortality. I can understand that he had a hard time imagine losing all your power strength and speed. Thats why I admire Ash. He is willing to give it all up so he can be with the love of his life.  The ending of this book is great. Its everything I could wish for.  Like always this was a fastpaced easy book. Before you know it it ends. Luckily for us there was a Survival Guide and a little interview with Julie Puck and Ash. The interview cracked me up. I can say by now that I have a new favorite author to add to my list.;Julie Kagawa

I fell in love with the fairytale world Danley created and all her magnificent characters. Be prepared to enter the Twelve Kingdoms filled with a mixture of different fairytales The story characters and worldbuilding is so layered and its hard to explain the story without giving spoilers. This is the best I can do  The woodcutter is the protector between the Realm of the Faerie and the Twelve Kingdoms of the humans. His forest is the boundary and he is part of it. He will do everything to protect it because it is his duty on earth. When an evil force tries to ruin the peace it is up to the woodcutter to stop them. Pixies are gone missing a mysterious house appears and vanishes and girls are found dead. In a race against the clock the woodcutter tries to protect the princesses and princes from our beloved fairytales against one of Odins hellhounds. The woodcutters job is to ensure that the princessprince get his true loves kiss. The hellhound cant attack after that kiss and he must save enough characters to weaken his enemies power. It is not going to be easy because the pieces of information are revealing a sinister plot to overrule the save and happy world they all know.  I LOVED it. I tried to decipher all the fairytales and it was so much fun to find them all. There are at least 12 different stories and they are used in a creative way. There are also some mythological characters like Odin and Baba Yaga. The woodcutter was a complex character. We start off slowly but I really feel like I know him. He is loyal to his wife the love of his life and he is brave strong and intelligent. Danley uses short chapters and it worked for me in this story. Her writingstyle is magical and detailed.  Yes if you are looking for something refreshing with fairytales mystery and interesting characters this is the book you want to pick up;Kate Danley

Especially in the beginning. I almost reached the point of putting this one in my DNF list of this year. Im glad that I continued because it became much better towards the end.  One of the hardest things was the fact that nothing really happens. Its difficult for me to read something that makes me feel bored. Jane accepted the job of governess when she finds out that the child if feycursed. Since Jane became an Ironskin in the Great War she believes she can help the little girl. Its not that easy. The girl keeps using her powers instead of her hands and Jane must use all her patience with Dorie. Thats the only thing Jane keeps doing throughout the whole book. The ending was slightly better but it wasnt enough.  Edward is gone most of the time. He is an artist and he locks himself up in his studio. A lot of ugly woman visit his shop and they leave with an unbelievable beauty. Sometimes Edward slips into the forest but Jane never questions this behaviour and she doesnt connect the dots. Jane and Edward hardly talk. This made it hard for me to understand their chemistry I never felt it. I didnt care for their relationship and I never felt like I knew Edward. He was too distant for me.  Jane is a sweetheart but she never became my friend. I loved the fact that she can live with her iron mask. She doesnt dwell in pity she accepts it. She was brave at the end of the book but I think I will forget about her soon.  The worldbuilding is a bit plain. Jane spends all her time in Edwards house and sometimes with her annoying sister Helen. We hardly get any information about the Great War. We get a glimpse of information at the ending but I wanted to know more.  Overall it was quite a nice story but it doesnt reach the high quality of the original story for me.;Tina Connolly

This book gave me a huge case of fangirling because damn this book is perfection. I was blown away by Grave Mercy so it seemed impossible to top that  not. LaFevers created another brilliant story which comes together with Ismae and Duval swoon I can only imagine how good part three is going to be. I recently found out that this book is partly based on Beauty and the beast so perhaps its not a coincidence I love it so much.  I am beautiful and educated and have all manners of useful  and deadly  skills but all of that together is worth less than a bucket of slops.  Sybella fascinated me from the moment I met her. Behind her kick ass outside hides a broken frightened girl who grew up in a terrible environment. Her father is a monster and Sybella got under the protection of her older brother Julian. His feelings for her grew deeper than brothersister and Sybella hungry for love embraced it. That is still something she struggles with and I loved seeing her accept her past. She is starting to realize that its not her fault and I liked that development. It was interesting to see how she grows into her role in life and how she embraces all her flaws. You have to admire her spirit and her free mind. She is dangerous with her weapons especially knives and she is good at hiding her fear. Robin created a magnificent character.  I simply want. I want him his strength his honour and his bedamned lightness of heart.  Sybella is on an important mission for the Abbess by giving her information about the Duchess biggest enemy dAlbret. He is still trying to force the Duchess into marriage and he is planning to destroy her from within her trusted circle. When Sybella is send to free the prisoner everything spins out of control. This man is better known as Beast because of his temper on the battlefield. He is huge loyal and incredibly strong in mind and body. When Sybella drags him from the prison mortally wounded he manages to kidnap her. Not able to kill dAlbret Sybella does everything in her control to nurse him. And soon she is starting to feel something she never felt before.  I stare down at his face. It has not grown more beautiful since I first found him festering in the dungeon and yet it is more dear to me than my own.  Beast is amazing. He is nothing like any other character Ive read about. He is often described as ugly but its not about how he looks its about his beautiful inside. He is protective over Sybella he is fierce and intelligent. I love his heart is and how such a huge and strong man can be so soft and tender. He will do everything to protect the people he love even if that means he has to sacrifice his life.  The plot is again fantastic. I always like politics in books especially against a historical background. The things that amazes me about this book is that nothing spectacular happens but you are still hooked to the story. Every page makes me hungry for more and I flew through the pages. Robin has such an addictive and easy writingstyle. I like the touch of the different Gods and what kind of children they create.  Do you like nun assassins Do you like strong female characters with great development Do you like sweet growing romance with a fantastic loveinterest Go and read it. If you dont like these things. Go and read it anyway. This is how you write a good book and a great sequel.;Robin LaFevers

There is something intriguing about the court and tension.  Summary.  John Parker is waiting for the personal illuminator for Henry VIII. Instead of the stinking arrogant man he expects Susanna arrives and she brings a lot of trouble. A man died on board and he gave her some valuable information she must deliver to the king. People are willing to kill her and on their way to the palace there are already two attempts to take her life.  People keep coming for them and slowly they unravel the real meaning behind the information. There is a huge complot against the King and the conspiracy comes from deep within his trusted circle. Its up to Parker one of his most trusted man to find out who is behind the attacks who wants to overthrow the King to put someone else on the throne.  In the time Parker and Susanna spend together they develop a feeling for each other. There is a certain chemistry between them from the moment they met and it only grows into something more. Susanna starts to play a big role in Parkers life but will she becomes his downfall if the enemy uses that against him  Opinion.  The worldbuilding is great. It felt like I was walking around next to Parker and Susanna. I could imagine the tension at court. Everybody is smiling but they will stab you in the back if they get the chance to get more status land and money. There is nobody you can really trust. Imagine how it must feel to be King. Luckily for Henry he has Parker. I would definitely trust my life around Parker. He is good in fighting and he will do anything to keep the persons he love safe.  Parker really grew unto me. From the moment I met him I knew I was going to love him. He is a bit distant and dark but he opens up around Susanna. He is merciless when they harm his lady and he is incredibly protective. He sounded very attractive and charming.  Susanna was a great character as well. She is sweet but definitely not someone who goes down without a fight. She isnt afraid to tell whats on her mind and she was able to make intelligent choices. I found her refreshing you could see she never grew up at court.  It was great to unravel the conspiracy together with them. Every piece of information leads us closer to the enemy and I was surprised by the ending. The enemy is clever and was wellwritten like the other characters. They play their part and they complete the story. You could see that Diener has done her research. The story felt realistic and it was nice to see her explanation at the end. About the real history and the things she made up but it still feels like it could have happened.  Im looking forward to continue the story with Parker and Susanna because in the next book Keeper of the Kings secret they are up to a lot of trouble. If you like history Philippa Gregory The Tudors and mystery with some romance this book is something for you;Michelle Diener

Wil Wheaton did one hell of a job in portraying the voice of Wade. He had me completely hooked to the story.  35 for story. I loved the plot but the pace is slow and tedious. There are a lot of descriptions and detail which could be a bit too much for my taste.  I loved Wade. I really liked Artemis H and Soto  Deito. It is a diverse cast with good dynamics.  I was appalled by the fact that some people were willing to kill in order to win the game but also not surprised because it is definitely something that would happen in real life too.  Wade is a Gunther one of the many people who are trying to find a hidden egg in a virtual world called the Oasis. It was created by Holiday who left his entire fortune up for grabs after his death. Five years have passed and no one has found the first clue yet until Wade stumbles upon it. This is the beginning of a lifedeath race to find the Egg.  Like I said there are parts that the author wrote with MANY descriptions. I love details but sometimes I wish the story would move forward a little faster. Im not sure if I would enjoy this as a written book because it was definitely thanks to Wheatons brilliant storytelling that I kept listening.;Ernest Cline

The only thing that would make this book better is some sort of list with words. I had troubles with some terms. But WOW what an amazing story  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  First impression WOW. Why did I wait so long From the first chapter I was hooked to this exciting story. This book also features one of my favorite things a map If you havent read this book please do yourself a favour and get a copy Because this is AMAZING.  Summary.  This wonderful story starts with two orphans Alina and Mal. They grew up together and they are now in the same army. Alina is a mapmaker Mal is a gifted tracker. They are sent to cross the Shadow Fold an impenetrable darkness that cleaves the country Ravka in two parts. When they are attacked by the Volcra terrible flying creatures and Mal is heavily injured Alina discovers her power and saves their lives. Nothing will ever be the same. Alina is whisked away to the royal court as a new member of the Grisha. That is a group of magical people led by the Darkling. Alina is trained in different aspects of her new life like controlling her power and learning more about the Grisha. She is unique and the key role in setting the country free.  Alina is forced to flee away from court after someone reveals a dangerous secret and that is how she runs into Mal. Together they must find an important animal. His antlers will function as an amplifier (to increase her power) and its the only way she can resist the hold of the Darkling.  Review  This book has a magnificent worldbuilding and an unique concept. The world is ruled by the King and Queen but the Darkling has the most power with his army of Grishas. There are different types of power and they all wear their own color keftas and titles. This is my only complaint about this book the new terms and words with Russian influences definitely added something to the sphere of the book but they were sometimes hard to define. I would have appreciated a list with words because its easy to get lost. But Bardugo did a great job on explaining everything and after a while everything made sense.  The plot was very exciting. Alina is going to play an important role in the survival of their world. The twist in the middle of the book was great and I couldnt stop reading. I wanted to find out about the real intention of the Darkling and how Alina was going to deal with it.  Alina is a great character. She is lost when she first uses her power and I loved her development. She is starting to understand her power and she finally finds a place in the world. She has quite some spunk. Everybody is afraid for the Darkling but she doesnt hesitate to stand up for herself. Alina is incredibly strong and I appreciated the fact that she never indulges in whining. She definitely had enough reasons to because she is separated from the person that makes her feel like she belongs somewhere Mal. I liked him. They were so cute together and you can see that they have a special bond.  He is more on the background but he is so loyal to Alina. He is willing to sacrifice everything for her.  That brings me to the mysterious Darkling one of my favorite characters from this book. I love complex characters and my oh my doesnt he sound like one hot guy (despite the fact that he is very old). I never knew what was going on in his mind and he was very unpredictable. One moment he shows his soft human side to Alina the other moment he chops a guy in half without blinking.  The ending had no cliffhanger. Yeay for books with normal endings that still manage to make you excited for the next one For me that is a true gift for writing. Most things are neatly wrappedup but there is enough space for the next book. I cant wait to read Siege and Storm  Quote  What are you smiling at  ....  Well He asked looking up at me.  Myself I admitted.  Are you that funny  Im hilarious.;Leigh Bardugo

Review coming but GO buy and read it. What are you waiting for  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I dont know where to begin because Im afraid that I am going to repeat myself over and over again about how wonderful this book is. This might be the best vampire book Ive read so far and Julie made me fall in love all over again with vampires. For me vampires are still fascinating and she made them original. Like they can bury themselves in the ground to stay safe from the sun if they cry their tears are made out of blood and some vampires only create Rabids.  But first let me tell you more about this amazing story. Im going to do my best to temper my love.  This book is dark. Vampires rule the world in huge cities which are scattered all around the world. In between there is nothing else than rabids so you dont want to leave your city. Allison  also called Allie  lives in one of those huge cities in the Fringe and she is an Unregistered person. Together with Rat Lucas and Stick (Stephen) she tries to stay alive. Being an Unregistered means that you dont exist so they dont get food and shelter. On the other hand they dont have to give their blood on blood day.  Allie must leave the walls of the city and go into the ruins to find food otherwise they will starve. The first day she finds a lot of food in a hidden basement but she also meets a rabid mole men and a vampire. Luckily for her  and us  she can escape. She will return with her group to gather the food but thats when everything goes wrong. The rabids kill Rat and Lucas damn those rabids are SO scary. During this scene my heart went faster because there was so much tension.  Allie saves Sticks live but now she is dying. When the vampire she met the other day gives her the choice she chooses to become the thing she hates most. From that moment she is a vampire and the one who created her  Kanin  becomes her teacher. And I dont know why but I found Kanin very attractive haha.  I really liked the information Kanin gives Allie. We get to know more about the vampires and their lives. The information was wellwritten and it made the story complete. It helped with the amazing world building. We also find out that Kanin is not just a vampire but a very important one and the Master of the city is looking for him. When they need to escape Allie must leave Kanin behind and she flees outside the city into some kind of desert. He comes in the hand of Sarren a vampire we met before and thats a creep Oh my he really made me feel scared.  Thats when she meets a group of humans. She decides to join them and we get to know Zeke (Elezekiel). I liked most of the people in this group. You have Dorothy a crazy woman who believes she can see Angels. Caleb the little boy who has an annoying sister called Ruth. And Darren who sounded like a nice boy.  The group gets a lot of trouble on their way to Eden. They believe that its a safe city where human are the rulers. On their way we are introduced to a group called Raiders. They are searching for Jeb in the name of their vampire king Jackal. Thats a bastard What a freak.  They already lost a lot of people but be prepared the group will lose some more.  But are they able to reach Eden Better does Eden really exists or is it just a fairytale  Allie is an amazing character. Perhaps one of the most believable characters Ive come across this year. I really could understand why she choose to become a vampire. When you are faced with dead I think everybody will try to escape that even if it means that you have to become a monster. She handles it very well and she is not a crybaby. She is trying to make the best out of her situation and I admire that. She is also very brave and the fact that she keeps her human feelings is wonderful. The way Zeke and Allie are growing to each other while she is trying to keep away from his is nicely done. Its no instant love.  There are a lot of great side characters something I always like in a story. There is always a certain tension in this book. When they are travelling they always look out for the rabids. Then the Raiders pop up and you find out about Jebs secret. There is always something happening thats why this book never fails to grab your attention.  Yeah you could say that I LOVE LOVE this book. And Allie fights with a Katana how great is that So go to the store and buy this book You wont regret it and believe me this book will end before you know it and you will regret that it went so fast. I certainly cant wait for the next book. Oh Im still blown away. It was SO good.;Julie Kagawa

One day later  I decided to make it 2 stars.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  I feel misled. This is what the blurb also says  Mila 2.0 is the first book in an electrifying scifi thriller series about a teenage girl who discovers that she is an experiment in artificial intelligence. A bold debut and the first book in a Bourne Identitystyle trilogy that combines heartpounding action with a riveting exploration of what it really means to be human.  I think even Disney gave me more heartpounding action. This story isnt a thrilling debut about an android. Its about a whiny angsty girl who happens to be a android but she has more feelings than the average teenager. Hardly anything happens except for running some fighting and a lot of crying. There were so many situations where I wanted to slam my head against a wall. Ill walk you through  The story starts after Mila and her mother moved to a small Minnesota town after her fathers death. She has made some questionable friends and she is trying to find a way to deal with her grief and her strange memories. When Mila is wounded in an accident she finds out that her mother is actually the scientist who helped to create her. She is an artificial intelligent and they are on the run for the company. She has far too many feelings for just an android so her mother stole her to give her a normal life. And that is where my annoyance starts. Mila does nothing else than complaining whining and crying over how unfair her life is. When a new hot guy called Hunter shows interest in her she is all over him. He is her cure they have a special connection and blablab. I dont get his part in this story and it felt forced. This middle part was so boring and I kept wondering where is the kick ass android I was hoping for  When Mila and her mother are discovered they try to run away. Mila wants to know more about the company but every time Nicole (mother) tries to tell something Mila becomes mad. She starts to scream that its not the time to talk about it and a couple of pages later she is complaining that Nicole is holding back information She also insists that she isnt her mother but she keeps calling her mom. There were many inconsistencies I didnt buy.  And WHAT THE HELL Mila. The first thing shes worried about when they are on the run is that she is leaving Hunter behind.. Are. You. Kidding. Me You just found out that there are people out there who want to capture you and you worry about a guy you met a few days ago She is pretty stupid for an android. When they are finally captured and Nicole tells her to hide her emotions what do you think she does YEAH. She talks about her emotions all the freaking time. Great way to keep them from killing you.  This story had enough potential but it was so disappointing. I dont think I will be reading the next book. I honestly dont care what is going to happen to Mila.;Debra Driza

Very touching and emotional. I wish I had a book like this when I was younger. One of the worst thing with bullying is how lonely it makes you feel. Its a good thing when you find out that you are not alone that it isnt about YOU. This book should be a required reading at school. I hope it would make people realize what an effect bullying can have on someone.  Dear bullies  where to begin Should I thank you because without you I wouldnt be the person I am today Should I pity you because you felt the need to tear someone down Should I be angry at you for making me feel so miserable and lonely while growing up  I used to believe you. I thought I was ugly stupid and useless  until the day came I realized I didnt want you to rule my life. When I look back I am so proud of younger Mel. I can now see how strong I actually was even when I felt like a nobody. I never said anything about it and I didnt stood up for myself like I would now but I never broke in front of you. I took it all and I guess thats a different kind of being brave.  So in the end I guess I should be thankful for you. Ive turned into this wonderful caring and loving person I am today. You showed me that the world can be a nasty place. That people can smile in your face but be mean behind your back. I can only hope that you are able to proud of the person you are today because apparently you wasnt when you took your dissatisfaction out on a shy girl )  I dont think I could ever forgive you but I certainly can forget you  the awesome happy girl you used to bully.  What I really liked about this book were the different ways authors shared their story. Some wrote a letter some wrote poetry or would share their past with the alphabet. It made the book even more interesting to read. I think it was good that some stories were even told by bullies  or at least people who werent brave enough to stand up for bullied friends. That is actually all I have to say about it.

Storyline Skye meets Asher on her birthday party. He and Devin  his cousin  are having a fight so thats not a really good impression. Apparently they are new in town and they are new students at her school. Better they are in her class and they are giving her a hard time. She is torn between the two guys who are completely differend. Asher is the badguy type. He likes to flirt with girls and he has a certain way of talking. Devin is shy and likes to stay in the background. Skye and he can really talk but she and Asher have some kind of spark they cant deny. Cassie  Skyes best girlfriend  is teasing her but the story gets more complicated when Skye finds out that they are there for a reason. They are watching her protecting her from herself. They both have the same goal but Devin warns her for Asher but Asher tells her to stay away from Devin. Skye is torn apart and she is struggeling with the discovery about her dead parents. Whose side is she on. Asher or Devin  Characters I liked them all but I hated Devin during the development of the story. He got very pushy and demanding so I really wanted Skye to end up with Asher. Sky herself is a nice and sweet girl but she can be annoying. She says one thing but her actions are doing the opposite thing. Girl make a decision And what the heck how can you fall in love with someone you barely know Love is not based on how goodlooking he is.. You must have something in common you must like his personality.. I also disliked the fact that every page is about her struggle. I dont like him.. I do like him.. I want him to leave.. I want him to stay. Even her schoolwork is suffering from it like get a grip on yourself But perhaps I think to much about stuff like that. I must be more romantic so I tried to read beyond those lines and I found a very small story.  Overall Like I said besides the whole love triangle the story lacks a real good storyline. I expected more action. The whole story should have been more about her past and her new gifts. Now it was more the story needed something more to make it less boring so we just put some gifts in it and at the end we come up with a little bit of action. Her gifts should have been the subject not just a side issue. Therefore I give this book 2.5 to 3 stars because I still want to read the next book.. I want to know how the story continues because the writing isnt bad. I just expected more of the storyline.;Jocelyn Davies

The first time I rated it on Goodreads with 3 stars and I enjoyed it again. There are some inconsistencies in this book but that didnt bothered me so much.  The background story isThe world is destroyed after a deadly virus. One man stepped up to rebuild the world. He started with The City of Sands and his title is King of the New America. Every girl is promised a future in this city but this is a lie.  The story starts with a happy event on Eves school. She is rewarded with the Medal of Achievement because of her good behaviour. She is everything they want smart healthy and she will do everything they tell her without any question. In a few days she will be transferred to the building across the lake where she can learn her trade. When one of the girls called Arden escapes Eve learns the truth and she decides to follow Arden. On their way to a safe place (Califia) they meet one of their enemies a boy. Caleb brings them to his hiding place filled with other boys so Arden can recover. Eve is frightened but she starts to understand that her teachers might have lied about men too.  The first thing if the blurb didnt told me Eves age (18) I think I would have estimated her age at 16. She felt a bit too mature and for such a smart girl she made some very dumb decisions. When the Kings men are after you why the hell would you tell your location over the radio Thats just plain stupid. The second thing I still dont get why these girls are supposed to hate boys. It makes no sense. They are isolated from the world and they never meet a boy why would you make them scared The third and last thing The King is after Eve but what makes her so special It was never explained but I hope that we get a good reason in Once.  But beside those three things I really liked the story. I was horrified by the situation in the building across the lake. The worldbuilding was okay. I still dont know how the plague started and what was wrong with the vaccination but I liked the dark setting. I thought Arden and Caleb were great characters. Arden is this tough no nonsense girl and Caleb is sweet and caring. The developing feelings between Caleb and Eve were welldone. She is of course scared for him but I loved how she slowly starts to open up for him and her feelings.Conclusion its definitely not the best book out there but it entertained me and it has a quick writingstyle. I cant wait to read Once because the ending is a bit of a cliffhanger (not a bad one).;Anna Carey

This book blew me away.  Summary.  This story starts on LuceroElisas (also known as Elisa) wedding. Its clear that this isnt based on love.

Invierne is strong because they have animagus people with magic  and she is the only one who can battle against it with her own magic.  When Invierne finds out that she is the Bearer the real trouble starts because they will do anything to get her stone into their hands.  Opinion.  This book is a roller coaster when it comes to your emotions Rae doesnt spare her main character. Be prepared thats all I have to say. There were some parts of this story.. If you have read this book I think you all know what Im talking about.  You are plunged into the story of Elisa a girl with a low selfesteem because of her appearance. She loves to eat and nobody can look beyond her fat appearance. I liked her right away. She is so kind and intelligent I recognized her shyness but I loved her development in this story. She is very brave. There is also Humberto this boy is great He is caring even when he is one of her captivators. He is doing it for a good cause and he treats her so sweet. I liked the way their feelings developed and I was rooting for them to be together. There are also other characters and they play important roles in this book. I love that the secondary characters were so wellwritten. You really get to know them.  This story is filled with action and worldbuilding. Even when they are traveling for over a month in the desert I was never bored by the story. There were enough details to understand how much Elisa suffered but it was fast enough to keep the pace high. The plot was great. I liked how this story builds toward it and it definitely delivered. I was afraid that the religious aspect might bother me but that wasnt the case at all  I cant wait to read the next book because Im hooked If you like (high) fantasy I recommend to read this book as soon as possible.;Rae Carson

To survive Calder and his sisters prey on humans and absorb their positive energy. Usually they select their victims at random but this time around the underwater clan chooses its target for a reason revenge. They want to kill Jason Hancock the man they blame for their mothers death.Its going to take a concerted effort to lure the aquaphobic Hancock onto the water. Calders job is to gain Hancocks trust by getting close to his family. Relying on his irresistible good looks and charm Calder sets out to seduce Hancocks daughter Lily. Easy enough but Calder screws everything up by falling in love  just as Lily starts to suspect theres more to the monsterinthelake legends than she ever imagined and just as the mermaids threaten to take matters into their own hands forcing Calder to choose between them and the girl he loves.One things for sure whatever Calder decides the outcome wont be pretty.;303;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1318984987m10479750.jpg;Lies Beneath (Lies Beneath 1);fantasy paranormal;3.5 stars.  Also posted on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Forget sweet little mermaids. And definitely dont picture The little mermaid Ariel when you think about this book. Mermaids are murderous creatures who feed on humans killing them by taking their energy and emotions away. They have irresistable good looks they can hypnotize you with their eyes they can transform into humans (and thats a painful transformation) and they have other tricks to make them even more dangerous.  There is only one boy who is trying to resist his urge to kill people and thats Calder. He lives with his three sisters  Maris Parvati and Tallulah  in the cold waters of Lake Superior. He likes the warm waters better so whenever he has the change he will go away. Unfortunately he is bound to his sisters by a bond only Maris can break. And if he wants that he will have to pay a price.  Years ago their mother died because of Tom Hancock. She saved his life and he promised his son Jason as a payment. Right after that Tom moved away with his family leaving their mother to suffer. This year Tom died and Jason returned to his familys homestead. The sisters are planning to kill him so they can collect the payment. There is only one problem Jason fears the water so they have to come up with a plan to lure him into the waters. Thats how Calder can get his freedom. He must seduce Hancocks daughter. Only Calder screws up because he falls for Lily.  Can he resist her so he can get his freedom Or will he follow his heart  Things I liked.  One thing I really liked was the whole new look I got from mermaids. I love the little mermaid and thats how I always saw them. Until now. From the three sisters Maris must be the scariest one. She is filled with hate and she has no mercy. She wants Jason to suffer while he is innocent. You have Parvati who likes to play with her victoms before she takes their lives and Talullah dont get fooled by her innocence.  Lily has a great personality. She likes to wear clothes that makes her different unique. She resists Calder and I appreciated that. Its not that she went all crazy and swoony over his good looks. Instead of that she admits that he freaks her out and that he is creepy. She is so right I would be scared in her place. Calder keeps popping up around her and nobody seems to know this guy. I liked how their feelings developed because Lily wants to learn more about him before she let herself fall in love with him.  Calder is a great guy because he really tries to resist his instincts. He doesnt want to be a monster and Im glad that he found a way to deal with it. It shows us that we CAN have control even when our whole body screams for it ) Isnt it great that we have a male POV  I also liked the ending. It was something I didnt expected and it makes me anxious for the next book. I wouldnt say its a cliff hanger but it certainly makes you excited  Things I didnt like.  The characters were great the storyline was good but there were still two things that bothered me. I never felt like I connected with Calder or Lily. We get to look through the eyes of Calder so Lily her thoughts and feelings are far away. I never felt like I really knew her. It was great that he was the POV because thats not something we read all the time but he still felt a little distance. As if he was trying to shield his real thoughts away from me (something mermaids can do by the way.) Yeah this was my main dislike. No connection.  Besides that there was something missing.. I cant put my finger on it but I think you know what I mean. Just the feeling that the story lacks of something important. Just one thing that makes the difference between a good book and a fantastic book.  If you like mermaids and you are looking for an original approach than this is definitely something for you. If youre not a fan of mermaids I dont think that this book will make you fall in love with them.;Anne Greenwood Brown

Thats a system everybody is connected to via a Vchip in their brains. Glitchers are dangerous and they must be reported but Zoe loves the emotions shes finally feeling.

Yeah. He brings her to his own community the Rebels.  1. I hated the language. There is a lot of cursing with strange words like Shunting and crackin hell They got on my nerve.  2. The worldbuilding. I couldnt buy it. The Community said that the Vchip would protect the people and everybody just took it without any problems The world up was destroyed and was supposed to be toxic. Why the hell would you want to live underground with a group of people you control like robots It makes no sense. It just felt wrong and unbelievable.  3. I couldnt connect with Zoe. The first 25 pages are only long descriptions about her glitches  boring  and I found her a bit plain.

I am someone who is pretty openminded when it comes to reading books outside my comfort zone so I bought it (I like the cover) and I dived right into it. I must say I wasnt blown away but I didnt hate it either.  The main character Lincoln is living his life without enjoying it. He is 29 recently moved back into his mothers house and he is doing a job that clearly doesnt excite him. He works at night spends most of his day eating and sleeping and the only social interactions he gets are when he plays Dungeon  Dragons with some friends. We see glimpses of his previous relationship and how it all stranded leaving a mark on him.  Lincoln was a difficult character and at the end Im still not sure if he grew onto me. His work is checking emails and making sure that it is not used for personal use and that there are no inappropriate contentwords. When JenniferBeths email exchanges get flagged he decides to read them and for some reason he never sends them a warning message. Instead he keeps reading their conversations and he is completely invested in their lives. I thought it was creepy especially when he starts to fall for one of them..  I dont know. Maybe Im just not romantic enough but falling in love with someone because they write funny isnt something that speaks to me. The fact that we get to know JenniferBeth only through their emails also made it hard to feel connected to them although I was quite fascinated by all the things they went through. Beth is in a relationship and is desperate to marry Jennifer is happily married and feels the pressure of having a baby but she believes she is not (perhaps never) ready for it.  I liked Lincolns development and how he starts to get out of his shell. I liked to read about his previous relationship but I did not really care for the romance and thats a shame because in the end thats what this story is all about.;Rainbow Rowell
355;10637959;4;236117;0062015052;Once upon a time Hazel and Jack were best friends. They had been best friends since they were six spending hot Minneapolis summers and cold Minneapolis winters together dreaming of Hogwarts and Oz superheroes and baseball. Now that they were eleven it was weird for a boy and a girl to be best friends. But they couldnt help it  Hazel and Jack fit in that way you only read about in books. And they didnt fit anywhere else.And then one day it was over. Jack just stopped talking to Hazel. And while her mom tried to tell her that this sometimes happens to boys and girls at this age Hazel had read enough stories to know that its never that simple. And it turns out she was right. Jacks heart had been frozen and he was taken into the woods by a woman dressed in white to live in a palace made of ice. Now its up to Hazel to venture into the woods after him. Hazel finds however that these woods are nothing like what shes read about and the Jack that Hazel went in to save isnt the same Jack that will emerge. Or even the same Hazel.Inspired by Hans Christian Andersens The Snow Queen Breadcrumbsis a story of the struggle to hold on and the things we leave behind.;312;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1300592738m10637959.jpg;Breadcrumbs;fantasy paranormal;4.5  This book is adorable Hazel is such a sweet character and I love to see her struggle. It reminded me of myself while growing up feeling an outsider from other kids. She is also brave and so loyal to Jack )  she is an adopted girl with a black skin and I love that. The illustrations were great the writingstyle is absolutely gorgeous 3  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  She felt like she was from a different planet than her schoolmates and maybe it was true.  This book is a creation of all the awesome things in the writingworld. There are great characters different fairytales illustrations and a wonderful almost poetic writingstyle. This book blew me away and its definitely a hidden gem. One I wouldnt hesitate to recommend to other people.  Once upon a time there were a boy and a girl  and they meant the world to each other until one day the boy completely changed. Jack got hit by an enchanted item and he was taken by the white queen. Hazel is not ready to leave him behind and embarks on a quest to save her best friend.  The first thing that is so good about this book is the ability to connect with the characters. First we have Hazel who feels lonely and different. She is bullied and called names and grownups dont seem to understand her. I felt sorry for her and since I was a bit lonely like her it was easy to relate to her. Her imagination is admirable and I love how brave she was when it came to Jack. It was great that this girl was adopted and had to deal with her parents divorce. It gave the story just that bit of extra depth and its good to see a girl with another skin tone.  Then there is Jack. He is her best friend and with him Hazel can be herself without holding back. Jack also has his problems at home and I think thats why they developed the ultimate friendship. It was so cute to see them together and how they fill up the empty spaces they complete each other. One of the best things about MG books is the lack of romance. A friendship between a boy and a girl can stay a friendship without complicating it.  I loved the twist on the original tale (The snow queen) and there are some other stories subtle scattered throughout the story. The author created her own story based on a fairytale and she did it with such a beautiful writingstyle. I was definitely surprised to find such a poetic and detailed way of telling in a MG. I think it would be a great book to read to your children before bed time especially with the illustrations but its also suited for adults. Definitely check it out  He was the only person who saw things for what they could be instead of what they were. He saw what lived beyond the edges of the things your eyes took in. And though they eventually grew out of Wonderland Artic spacepeople tea parties that essential thing remained the same. Hazel fit with Jack.;Anne Ursu Erin Mcguire

In the beginning I was afraid I wasnt going to like this book. I had a hard time with Jeane and Michael. Jeane is this dork who is incredibly snappy and snobbish to normal people. She discusses with teachers is mean to everyone around her and she feels like she only can be herself on her blog Adorkable and social media. Her relationship with Barney is something I never understood. They cant even kiss each other. Michael is the golden boy. He lets his parents dictate his life and his relationship with Scarlett is hilarious  in a bad way. They only have one in name but its clear there is no chemistry between them whatsoever.  The only way that connects Jeane and Michael is that Barney  Scarlett are flirting but everyone seems to be content to keep it that way. When Jeane outs them by writing a blog post Michael is furious on her. He cant stand her and her ugly face  something he likes to point out a lot  but they still end up kissing a lot.  I was confused and annoyed by them especially how often Michael told us in his POV how unattractive Jeane is. Just.. no. But when the story continues they start to develop and become both more likable. I started to enjoy their snappy conversations and how they are both completely the opposite. I also liked how Jeane embraces her dorkiness and that she makes it her own brand. I understood her feelings for blogging and the friends she makes online and I disagreed with Michael because he believes its all fake. I think their background stories make it easier for me to understand why they both did and said things that bothered me in the beginning.  And credits for the realistic view on sex and how awkward it can be  Despite some of those bumps I couldnt put this book down and I read it in one sitting. Its very easy and quick to read and I like how it all ended.;Sarra Manning

So far so normal. Then she gets a visit from Mason and he declares that hes a harpy. Avery has stolen his fathers magic. First she thinks hes complete lunatic but then he reminds her of something. During her holiday she picked up a mysterious shell. It hurted her hand and it has a strange color now. Apparently the shell was a locket and she broke it so the magic transferred into her hand. Shes now in big danger because the Band (the bad harpies) are after the magic and theyll even kill her for it.  Then theres a lot of running and fighting. Youll get to no more of Mason (theres more than you expected) and the ending wants to let you read more.  Im not very fond of Avery but I also didnt dislike her. Its just.. I missed a connection.

Just a funny little story between book three and four.;Julie Kagawa

With Gabriel at her side Rhine travels through an environment as grim as the one she left a year ago  surroundings that mirror her own feelings of fear and hopelessness.The two are determined to get to Manhattan to relative safety with Rhines twin brother Rowan. But the road there is long and perilous  and in a world where young women only live to age twenty and young men die at twentyfive time is precious. Worse still they cant seem to elude Rhines fatherinlaw Vaughn who is determined to bring Rhine back to the mansion...by any means necessary.In the sequel to Lauren DeStefanos harrowing Wither Rhine must decide if freedom is worth the price  now that she has more to lose than ever.;341;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1324955449m11112619.jpg;Fever (The Chemical Garden 2);youngadult;This was a great sequel  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Because even if the lie is beautiful the truth is what you face in the end.  Fever continues right after Wither. It has been a while since Ive read that book but it wasnt hard to follow the storyline. Rhine ran away with Gabriel in the hope of finding her lost twin brother Rowan. Instead they end up in a situation that looks even worse than the mansion she left behind. This part of the story gave me the creeps.  Rhine comes into the hands of a Madame. This is one freaky lady. She is mentally unstable and extremely suspicious. She believes she can earn a lot of money with Rhines beauty and she wants to get rid of Gabriel because she is afraid he is a spy. I was happy that Rhine managed to stay strong and hopeful. The situation looked bad but she kept believing that they could get away. With clever thinking she saved Gabriels life and she was a good character. Not my favorite but I liked reading about her.  I wasnt very invested in Gabriel though. I give him a lot of credits for leaving his good life behind but he got on my nerves sometimes. I think its because he was such a defeatist in many situations. He made everything a bit dark and moody  I wanted him to have more faith in himself and Rhine. The situation was negative enough. The secondary characters were interesting especially Lilacs past. It made me admire her spirit and courage even more.  The thing about hope is that it doesnt go away even when it serves no purpose.  There is also the tension of Vaughn. He manages to track Rhine down and he tries to bring her back. She refuses but still ends up drugged in the mansion in the basement as part of his new experiments. It was frightening to see what Vaughn is capable of and how easy he uses people like they are objects.  I was happy this story delivered. Keep in mind that this book is dark and heavy. I dont think everyone will like this but it worked for me. I have high expectations for Sever.;Lauren DeStefano

The person who wrote the blurb did a great job in lying. It might sound like an interesting book but believe me its not. Im still not sure how I managed to read this book. There were several moments where I wanted to DNF it but I was hoping it would become better. So I continued and I must say the ending made it a little bit better. In combination with a not too bad protagonist 2 flowers instead of 1.  The main subject in this book is one family who find out about Katerinas secret and they want to use her to gain more power. The Prince Danilo wants to marry her to use his full potential as supernatural and Katerina is swept away to his family. In the mean time an army of dead soldiers has been raised and Katerina is trying to find out who is behind it.  It was boring. I liked the begining. Katerina summoned a dead animal and she scared herself so much that she swore to never speak about her giftcurse. That almost the only thing we get to see about her Necromancer power. I wish it was more explored. The author could have given her any other power and it wouldnt have made a difference for the story. Katerine wasnt a bad character. I like that she still tries to achieve her dream becoming a doctor (which isnt allowed in Russia in this time period) The problem is that I just didnt care for her. I felt so disconnect from the story and I was hoping to get more action or excitement. Instead I got more names and titles making it even more confusing. There were so many people in this story some who didnt even matter and it made the story messy. I still have no idea who everyone is  I dont even know who is in charge. There are countless amounts of princes dukes and other titles.  Luckily the ending was more exciting. Katerina is practically kidnapped and used in a ritual for Danilos powers. They unleash something dark and Katerina must fix it in the name of the tsar. Im happy that its quite wrapped up because that means I dont have to read the second book  at least not anytime soon.  Many other bloggers rate this book with 4 even 5 stars but Im sorry.. I just dont see it.;Robin Bridges
367;11235712;5;236117;;Sixteenyearold Cinder is considered a technological mistake by most of society and a burden by her stepmother. Being cyborg does have its benefits though Cinders brain interference has given her an uncanny ability to fix things (robots hovers her own malfunctioning parts) making her the best mechanic in New Beijing. This reputation brings Prince Kai himself to her weekly market booth needing her to repair a broken android before the annual ball. He jokingly calls it a matter of national security but Cinder suspects its more serious than hes letting on.Although eager to impress the prince Cinders intentions are derailed when her younger stepsister and only human friend is infected with the fatal plague thats been devastating Earth for a decade. Blaming Cinder for her daughters illness Cinders stepmother volunteers her body for plague research an honor that no one has survived.But it doesnt take long for the scientists to discover something unusual about their new guinea pig.

Its amazing I cant wait to read the next book because the ending makes you greedy for more. If you want to find out for yourself here you can read an expert from the story Chapter 1  5. And there is an extra story and you can find it over here Glitches. It tells the story of a young Cinder and her stepfather Garan. It broke my heart.  Summary.  Linh Cinder lives in New Beijing and works as a (talented) mechanic. Shes not a normal girl she is a cyborg. She was adopted by her stepfather who found her somewhere in Europe. After his death she became a slave for the family but things are about to change.  On a normal working day an unusual man walks into her store. Its Crown Prince of the Eastern commonwealth Kaito (also called Kai) He wants her to restore one of his androids. After he leaves there is an outbreak in the store across her shop. There is another case of Letumosis a dangerous disease which already claimed many lives. When her sister Peony catches the disease her stepmother reports Cinder as volunteer. They are using cyborgs to come up with a medicine since the King has fallen ill.  Cinder is perfect for the job. The doctor wants to use her blood for the cure. He will provide Peony with a vaccine if Cinder helps him. In the mean time she keeps running into Prince Kai and he gives her a lot of attention. Its clear that he quite likes her but there are rumors that he will be married to Queen Levana a Lunar. That would be a disaster since the Lunars are a treat to the whole world. When Cinder discovers some terrible news after the arrival of the Queen on earth its up to her to inform the prince. Thats not without danger.  The doctor provided her with a lot of revealed secrets around her mysterious past. She cant remember anything from before the hover incident (which claimed her hand feet and parents) and when she finds out who she truly is she must run for her life. The Queen wants her dead for a good reason. If Cinder manages to escape she will become on of the most wanted fugitives.  Opinion.  Cinder is a wonderful girl. She is brave and she even risks her life in order to protect Kai. There is absolutely no instant love between the two. Better yet Cinder tries to push him away but he keeps coming back for her. She lives in a horrible family. Peony is a sweet girl but Pearl needs a good smack in the face. Her stepmother Adri doesnt appreciate Cinder and she gives her a hard time. Cinder still manages to stay caring and kind.  Kai is great and I love how we really get to meet him. The chapters switch between Kais and Cinders story. We also have the doctor. All the information we get comes from him and I found him touching. There is something warm and friendly about him and in the end he is the one who tries to save Cinder.  I saw some parts of the story coming but it was still satisfying when the plot reveals itself. This book surely doesnt disappoint I love the concept and the way the story unfolds. The big lines of the real Cinderella story are their but Marissa found a way to create a wonderful new story.  The worldbuilding is great. We get a lot of information about The Lunars and their Queen. Its not strange that the Earth is afraid of her. She uses her glamour to silence her people and she kills everyone who stands in her way  including her niece Princess Selene. Although.. there are whispers that the princess survived and Prince Kai is searching for her so he can marry her.  The writing style is flawless and I cant wait to find out what will happen next. Cinder will meet Red Riding Hood how awesome is that;Marissa Meyer

It was a bit strange here and I find the show more believablr. But still a great book. So detailed and filled with these amazing and developed characters. )  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  My first thoughts after finishing this book I FINALLY did it. I think Ive read one of the most popular fantasy book and Im happy that I read it. This book is huge but it never felt like reading 811 pages. It was a quick and interesting read that makes me hungry for more. I absolutely LOVE the TV show and after watching the three seasons in a very short time I couldnt ignore the books any longer. Credits to the TV show so far they follow the storyline perfectly and I even liked the change they made. They adjusted the ages because a fourteen year old girl having sex with an adult on TV would be weird. I think I even prefer the older characters and I keep these actors in mind when I read the books.  WHEN YOU PLAY THE GAME OF THRONES YOU WIN OR YOU DIE. THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND.  Im not going into details because that would be so much work. This book has a truly wonderful complex worldbuilding with many developed characters. It was easy to keep track of them though. There are some main characters (dont get too attached though that doesnt mean a thing) and many secondary characters. They have distinct voices and important roles in the story and that makes this such a masterpiece. I was happy with the summary at the end about all the families and their members. It was fun to read.  Every chapter tells the story from another POV like Eddard Stark (Ned) or Tyrion Lannister (one of my favorite characters). It was fascinating to see how everyone feels and thinks in certain situations. There was one POV I disliked though because I just cant stand Sansa. There is something about this stupid girl that annoys me and I must admit that I scanned her pages. One of the things I admire is the fact that every character has its strong points and flaws. Nobody is a 100 good or evil and that makes it realistic. I also love the setting and the hints of fantasy like all the talk of the Others or in the TV show white walkers and dragons. I cant wait to see more of this.  Keep in mind that you need to like politics. This book isnt a hardcore fantasy book because its all about intrigues and betrayal. One family conspiring against the other with the Lannisters on top of the list. If you follow my blog longer you know that I like historical fiction especially in The Tudor era  this book reminds me of it. Everyone is trying to gain more power and money and they will do everything to get it. Its after all The Game of Thrones and you either win or die.  NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU ARE FOR SURELY THE WORLD WILL NOT. MAKE IT YOUR STRENGTH. THEN IT CAN NEVER BE YOUR WEAKNESS. ARMOR YOURSELF IN IT AND IT WILL NEVER BE USED TO HURT YOU.  If you are interested in a short summary of this book  There are basically three main lines in this story. One is about Ned Stark who becomes the new Hand of the King after Jon Arryns death. The king is one of his friends Robert Baratheon who is married to Cersei Lannister. They have three children together but Ned discovers a huge secret and when he tries to tell the truth he is captured for treason. One of his sons Robb leads an army to free his father. The second one is about Ned Starks bastard Jon Snow. He decides that its time for him to do something with his life and he joins the Night Watch at the Wall. This Wall protects the seven Kingdoms also Westeros from the evil that lurks outside it especially when Wildlings are gathered together as an army by one man called Mance. The last one is about Danaerys Stormborn the last Targaeryen with her brother Vicerys. He marries her off to Khal Drogo in order to use his army to cross the sea and capture his thrown which is currently hold by Ursurper Robert. Robert killed their father who was called the mad king.;George R.R. Martin

At. That. Cover.  Bloody gorgeous.   I loved the inside too 3 Review coming soon  Looking for something sweet with a strong heroin This is the book you want to read. I must admit that I fell in love with the cover but the inside is just as pretty  Even if he was a thief he was my thief. I could not push him away anymore.  Summary.  This story is all about Tess a daughter from a blacksmith and a woman with no backbone. Her father is abusive but Tess still remains strong determined and intelligent. She never wants to get married because she doesnt want to became her mother. If she will ever find a husband he must agree with all the terms she came up with. Such as allowing her to go to the Dragonwoods. She is drawn to the woods although its forbidden to enter.  Thats the reason she is accused of witch craft and she is tortured. She told the witch hunter that her best friends Meg and Poppy went with her into the woods. The three girls must flee and they live in the forest. Not the safest place with all the dragons and faeries in it. Still Tess isnt afraid and she is always trying to make the best of it. She feels really guilty for betraying her friends and she wants to do anything in the world to make it right.  One day they get to meet Garth. He is a woodsman and he offers them shelter in his house. Tess met him before in one of her fire visions and she doesnt know what to think of him. Is he a friend or an enemy Perhaps Garth is not the person he pretends to be.. And perhaps Tess is more than just a girl.  Conclusion.  Tess is a wonderful girl. Very loyal to her friends. Even when she is desperately looking for affection she never backs away from her own opinion. When she finds out about a secret her mother kept from her her whole world changes. She finally understand her desire to be in the Dragonwoods.  Garth was also a nice character even when I couldnt read his mind. He felt distant in the beginning but thats what makes him so interesting. He is mysterious and I liked how I got to know him better. He grew on me.  Poppy was a bit dumb. She was very sweet and described as incredibly handsome but she wasnt bright. I loved the fact that she followed her heart though.  This story has every element you could ask for. I love the feeling this book gave me. There are dragons and fairies. There is magic and romance. The story tackles a difficult subject (abusive father) but manages to show us that you have to fight. Never let anyone bring you down. The words are flowing and its such a smooth and easy writing. I certainly cant wait to read other books from this author.  Definitely read this one if you like fairytales This book has the same feeling to it.;Janet Lee Carey

But it wasnt bad ) Review coming soon.  also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I think I expected too much from this book so I was a bit disappointed. This book has a lot of elements I normally like but it never managed to wow me. That might be because of Rachel but I liked it enough to continue the series some time.  Summary  Rachels father is announced dead when he doesnt return from a mission. Logan becomes her new Protector and she is not happy with him. When she told him years ago that she loved him he turned her down. Rachel is planning to escape from the city to find her father she doesnt believe he is dead. He is the best tracker and that is why Rachel is so different from other girls. She learned hunting and fighting. When Rachel is caught during her escape she is brought before the Commandant. He blackmails her if she doesnt find the package her father hid in the forest he will kill Logan. Logan is thrown into a cell and Rachel tracks into the woods to save him. This is not without danger in the forest lives The Cursed One something that is similar to a dragon. But Logan isnt planning to leave her alone and he manages to break free. Together they must unravel the mystery around her fathers package.  Review  Rachel started as a great character. She stayed true to her father and she had some spunk. I liked that her father educated her in hunting and fighting. Its a shame that these potential awesome aspects were overshadowed by things I didnt like about her. This made it a bit hard to connect to her. She does irrational things and I didnt like the way she treated Logan. I dont like the grudge she holds against him because he was just honest all those years ago. She had some whiny moments and I sometimes wanted to facepalm but Logan made up for it. He was intelligent and I like how crafty he is. He made some great inventions like his tracking device. I thought he was sweet and very patient with Rachel. Despite that I didnt feel the chemistry between them. I didnt care for it although this was cute  I want Rachel. Not because shes beautiful. Not because shes my responsibility. I want her because she makes me laugh. Makes me think. Inspires me to be the kind of man I always hoped Id be. I want Rachel because the thought of a life without her is more than I can bare.  I like how he loves her not only for her beauty but also for the things he admires about her personality.  The plot is alright. The Cursed One wasnt explored as much as I wanted and I found the pacing a bit off sometimes. The beginning of the real story takes a lot of time and I wished it went a bit faster. This book feels more like a stepup for the second book.  I might sound a bit harsh but it wasnt a bad book at all. I found it enjoyable but not as good as I thought it would be. A solid 3 flowers book.;C.J. Redwine

This one makes a perfect ending to Sophies story. I did find some exiting news on my favorite website Goodreads. There is coming a Hex Hall Spinoff  Summary.  This story starts right after part 2. Demonglass. Just to refresh your memory a bit Sophie was under attack she ran away into a portal and now she arrived at the Brannicks.  The Brannicks are one of her sworn enemies but her mother is there. Sophie was gone for 17 days because the portal had some troubles. You can imagine that her mother is extremely happy to see her. Her father Cal Jenna and Archer are still gone. Sophie discovers that her mother is there for a good reason. The Brannicks are offering their help to Sophie because they believe she is the only one who can stop the world from ending. There is only one problem her powers are still locked. Thats where Elodie comes floating into the story. They have a special bond so Elodie can take over Sophies body and use her magic. They are slowly developing some sort of friendship and that was nice to see.  They come up with a plan to stop the leaders from Hex Hall. They are creating demons at Hex Hall and they want to use them to create fear under the Prodigium. When Sophie is sucked to Hex Hall she finally meets Archer again  and of course our good Jenna The Brannicks continue with the original plan collection Demonglass out of Hell.  Can Sophie escape from Hex Hall and are they able to put an end to the creation of demons Be prepared for a bumpy ride filled with action loss and friendship  Opinion.  There is a huge lost in this book and it nearly made me cry. This person was always a bit on the background but still managed to capture a piece of my heart. Its terrible that it happened but it was for a good cause.  Friendship plays a big part in this story and I like that. You always need someone in a battle and Sophie is depending on the people around her. And those people are fantastic. Her best friend Jenna who supported her from the beginning. I think that their friendship is one of the best Ive read about so far. They have this special connection going on. Her new made friends at The Brannicks one of the most unsuspected people and of course her mother. She is tough You can see where Sophie got her awesomeness from.  Like I said before this book is filled with action. Things are spinning out of control and their world is soon collapsing into darkness. The demons are loose and they form a big danger. There is this constant tension and youre just waiting for the big moment. The plot went a bit too fast for my taste but I was still satisfied with the ending.;Rachel Hawkins

But she wasnt afraidwhich was odd because although Aaryn the person asking her that question was her best friend he was also a vampire. In fact she was surrounded by hundreds of vampires.But they werent your typical vampires. They were Stregoni Benefici the good kind. Nor was Emma your typical elf. She was the Golden Healer and she alone could save the Stregoni Benefici from the Dark Enchantress.

I was very glad with this opportunity so thank you Christine  If I make mistakes please try to forgive me. English is not my birth language.  There are little spoilers  Ive never read a christian fantasy story before and most of the time I enjoyed it. The only think I really disliked was the way Chrystine handled her father. I just couldnt understand why she forgave him like that and why she still loved him so much. But hey thats because Im not a forgiving person and I just cant believe that God can love a person who hurts other people..  Alright thats just a little thing. The way the book starts fantastic. It made me very excited and anxious about the rest of the book. I like the fact that shes an elf because they are one of my favorite magical creatures. She has the gift of healing (but it takes a lot of practise) and shes very special. Instead of a green tumb and toe hers are gold.  One thing I found very special about this book is that there is this special college. There are magical and nonmagical students. Every magical person must attend only magical lessons until theyve mastered their gift. Chrystine is allowed to follow nonmagical lessons.  And its nice to see that this is a real love story. Not like girl meets boy and BOOM they are in love. This love is developing itself through the story. After years shes falling in love with Aaryn and she has accepted the fact that he doesnt like her that way. (But later on you notice that he lied about that just to protect her.)  Aaryn is very strong and has sensitive ears and eyes. He has a temper and when he gets wet his skin turns a brillian shade of green (very funny detail). Chrystine thinks that hes some special elf but then he tells her his real story hes a very old vampire. And I mean very old. (I laughed when Chrystine thought about Twilight when Aaryn told her that hes a vampire. I just read Twilight so it was fun to hear that title p) He also tells her that he belongs to the good vampire. He is immune to blood and he lives on an elixer of minerals an herbs (very creative) Good vampires protect the people by killing the bad vampires and they are searching for the good healer. He thinks that its Chrystine because she has the golden toe and dumb.  She is the one to defeat the evil sorceress. The dark enchantress has created the vampires and she wants to take over all the worlds. She still exists but shes waiting to gain enough power to destroy everything. She must be defeated before she can complete her evil plan.  They leave this world with Lund  a teacher  to go after the evil sorceress. (I like the way they travel with a necklace through a portal into another world) They defeat the evil sorceress and they live happily ever after D. I love that Chrystine and Aaryn come together.  Ive read this book in a few hours because it read so fast and I wanted to know more about Aaryns story. I really like Chrystine and Aaryn. They are fun and nice. The only thing I didnt like was the ending of the sorceress. It started like there was going to be a fight or something like that but instead Chrystine suddenly knows the spell and then its over. It was a bit of an anticlimax.  I would definately read more books from this author ).;Christine E. Schulze

And one hour to escape.Because tonight theyll come for her.;368;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1331907810m11556960.jpg;Crewel (Crewel World 1);youngadult;Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  This book has to be one of the most unique and different books Ive read so far. There is really no other book I can think off that follows such a storyline. So if you are looking for something else this is definitely the book you want to pick up.  But someday my parents will explain what Spinsters really do  that no matter how good their intentions with absolute power comes corruption.  Summary.  Adelice lives in the world of Arros ruled by The Guild the Spinsters and the Creweller. Becoming a Spinsters is the dream of every girl but not for Adelice. Her parents trained her so she would fail at the test but she made a mistake and now they are coming for her. She is forced to leave everything she knows and loves like her little sister Amie to become a Spinster.  Her treatment is different from the other Spinsters and she finds out that there is something going on. Cormac  one of the most powerful man  has a certain interest in her and she even gets to meet the Creweller. Things are spinning out of control when she meets Eric and JostenJost. She is trying to come up with a plan to escape but when she is faced with a horrible future there is only one thing she can do..  Opinion.  The idea of a world build upon another world by the hand of The Guild is fascinating. The Creweller provides the raw material so the Spinsters can weave. They are in total control. From the weather to the amount of babies every family can get your entirely life is in their hands. They can take your thread out of the weave if it becomes fragile  and within seconds you disappear into nothing. This all happens in a loom a special machine that shows the threads.  You can see that the worldbuilding was phenomenal but I became slightly bored towards the end. I wished that there was more story than explanations about the world and weaving. All I really got was Adelice and her lovetriangle (yes unfortunately) with Eric and Jost combined with a little bit of plotting for an escape. She started as a great character but slowly I noticed little irritation points. For example Josten just told her about his tragic story and all she can think of is  I cry because Im a stupid girl who cant curb the jealousy and inferiority I feel towards Rozenn for getting him first.  Really He revealed an important piece of his life and this is the first you think of I also questioned the fact that everybody admired her and her courage but when you think of it there is nothing brave about her. Oh well the story was entertaining enough and the end makes me curious about the next book. It was very surprising and I didnt see it coming.;Gennifer Albin

There is much more action and less Tucker obsession. It was fastpaced and I liked the plot. There was a twist I suspected but some things still managed to surprise me.  Claras life is changing drastically when she has another vision. Someone she loves is going to die and there is nothing she can do about it. She is afraid that its Tucker and that is when she transforms into a stalker. She creeps to his house to watch him sleep in the night (Twilight anybody) I understand why she is protective but this was so weird. The only thing I liked about it was the fact that Clara knew she was acting creepy and we get a lot of ClaraTucker time Tucker stole my heart. He is so sweet and I love how he handles the situation.  Clara also has two stalkers on her own. Christian and Samjeeza (the Dark Wing from Unearthly) Christian is sure about their destiny together and Clara is doing her best to ignore him. That is hard when Angela decides to start an Angel club where they keep each other updated. He keeps popping up and Tucker is getting annoyed. I was mentally shouting at Christian to back off and there were several moments I wished I could smack him. I understand that it is hard for him but he just has to fight against it like Clara.  Like things arent hard enough already Jeffrey is acting strange and her father shows up after all those years revealing old secrets. What I appreciate is the fact that there is no information dump. We slowly get information about Sam and the purpose of Angels on earth. I still find Cynthias take on Angels unique.  I cant wait to see what is going to happen in the last book.  Ive learned that a storm isnt always just bad weather and a fire can be the start of something. Ive found out that there are a lot more shades of gray in this world than I ever knew about. Ive learned that sometimes when youre afraid but you keep on moving forward thats the biggest kind of courage there is. And finally Ive learned that life isnt really about failure and success. Its about being present in the moment when big things happen when everything changes including myself.;Cynthia Hand

Insurgent picks up right after Divergent. Since Ive read it right away it didnt bother me but I can understand that it can be difficult if there is a lot of time between the two books. The group is now with Amity. When Tris hears a conversation between Marcus and Johanna (Amity leader) she finds out that Erudite attacked Abnegation to get their hands on information and he wants to get it back. Abnegation wanted to show it to the rest of the factions but Erudite is trying to stop it. When Tris tells Four about this he doesnt believe it. His father is a liar so he cant be trusted and they have to focus on the most important thing destroying Erudite.  Amity finally decides that they want to stay neutral in this war. That doesnt stop Erudite from attacking them. They must flee and in the end Tobias Tris Caleb and Susan are able to get away with the train filled with factionless. These people arent so factionless as it seems. The leader wants to overthrow Erudite and she is going for something more ending all the factions.  There is a lot of travel in this book and that makes it hard to follow sometimes. They come in a lot of places and sometimes I forgot where they were. When there is a second attack Erudite forces the group to deliver one Divergent to them. Tris is on a suicide mission in this whole book so she decides that its a good idea to turn herself in. Can she escape And can she find the information Marcus desperately wants  Sleep he says. Ill fight the bad dreams off if they come to get you.  With what  My bare hands obviously.  Opinion.  There were a couple of things that really bothered me. First of all Tris is different. She is more whiny about little things like her struggling with holding a gun. Where is her brave character I can understand that certain things changes you because a lot of things happened in the first book.. But come on She keeps pushing herself in these dangerous situations she was supposed to be Erudite. You would expect more from her.  That brings me to her other strange decisions. She completely trusts Marcus even when there is no evidence of everything he is saying. And the super secret information that cant be shared with words wasnt that spectacular at all. I must admit that one thing surprised me but it wasnt such a thrilling climax. Im happy that we got the information because it gave me more answers.  The changed behavior of Four brings me to the second point. He acts like a total douche bag. I didnt like their relationship. At all. They are mean and they dont trust each other. They keep lying and they do so many things behind each others back. They make up for their fights by kissing and thats it.  There are a lot of people in this book. So many that it was hard to keep track on them. They die page after page and in the end it just felt like ohhh there goes another. I wished I felt more for them. Its also hard to keep track of where they are because there are many places they visit.  And the last points is the ending. How. Can. You. Do. That. It stops just like that. I can understand the use of cliffhangers but this was.. Like she couldnt come up with a descent ending.  These things were just minor critics I have about this book because in the end I liked it It was not as good as Divergent but I certainly cant wait to read the next one. Tris and Four are becoming my friends even with their flaws.The writing style was great and there is still enough action besides all the talking to keep it interesting. I still like the idea of this series and I want to find out where we are heading are we finally going to find out what is behind the fence I really believe that the last book will be as good as the first one. You see these things often. The second book always suffers it always lacks the awesomeness of the first book.;Veronica Roth

I had a hard time with this book. It has a nice fairytale feeling but it was very slow. Especially in the middle part where the story dragged a little but the ending made it so much better It delivered a great plot and I end up liking it.  Summary.  Jennys brother was swallowed by the trees and taken by The Greenman but nobody believed her. Her parents never stopped mourning over their son and Jenny is happen to go away. She is planning to go to college in another town and she wants to say goodbye to Tom. Thats before she hears his music he was a gifted musician. Without thinking Jenny storms into the woods where she meets Jack and Puck. Jack has many names but one of his most important tasks is to guard the edge. Jenny is in grave danger and he must help her to return to her world. One problem she doesnt want to return without Tom.  Jack is trying to keep her away from the dangerous Queen of the forest Titania but King Oberon is also after Jenny. In this world she isnt just Jenny. She is someone special and everybody wants her for their own reasons. Even Jack has a lot to win if he turns Jenny in. Can she survive the forest and escape with Tom Or will she lose even more  Opinion.  The treachery of beautiful things indeed. Faeries are known for their beauty but they cant be trusted. There are some conspiracies. Puck answers to Oberon Jack is torn between two masters and all he actually wants is his heart and freedom. I liked them. Jack sounds handsome with his two different colored eyes and his dark hair.  Jenny was a damsel in distress in the beginning of the story. She doesnt know what is going on and she depends on Jack. She strongly stands up for what she wants (finding Tom) and she will do anything to achieve that even risking her own life. She became more kick ass towards the end of the story where she is trying to get Jack back. I thought she was nice she has a good heart but that also made her naive in some situations.  There is some romance in this story  like you can expect from a fairytaleish book  but it doesnt play the main role. Its all about her search for Tom while everybody is looking for her. I loved the whole background story. Why they all want Jenny and who Jack really is.  The writingstyle is pleasant but sometimes a bit slow like I already said. It does paint a pretty picture of the forest and the creatures in it. The descriptions are welldone. I was never bored and there is a lot going on. One moment Jack is trying to persuade her to leave the forest the other moment her soul is taken and he must fight to gain her back. And the end I thought it was incredibly sweet I was very happy with the ending.;Ruth Frances Long

This book was my Epic Rec recommendation from Juhina  Maji bookshelf. Im so happy I finally took the time to read this book because it was good Im not completely in love but definitely interested enough for the next book.  Ive already learned Parseltongue. What else is there  The story is pretty interesting. Mara just woke up in the hospital. She was in an accident and three of her friends are now death. Mara has no memories about what happened and things are about to get weird. Her family moves to another town and Mara keeps seeing things that arent there. Her hallucinations are taking over and she even gets nightmares of moments before the accident. In the mean time she befriends the popular hot guy Noah Shaw  and therefor makes some enemies. Noah has a strange interest for her and she cant shake of the feeling that something is wrong with her.  The first thing I noticed is the engaging writingstyle. There is no doubt about it Michelle is a gifted author. This book hooked me from the start and wouldnt let me go even when something happened I normally dont like.  No I said louder this time. I mean asscrown. The crown on top of the asshat that covers the asshole of the assclown. The very zenith in the hierarchy of asses I said as though I was reading from a dictionary of modern profanity.  In the beginning its all about Mara and her strange hallucinations. I loved how creepy they were and what influence they had on her. I was just as confused as she was  I couldnt wait to find out what was going on. I also liked her. She felt realistic feeling smothered by her protective mother and worried by her dreams. When she meets Noah the story gets a romance focus. In most books that would turn me off. I wasnt a fan of it here either but there was something intriguing about Noah.  He sometimes bordered on the line of becoming an asscrown but he wasnt so bad overall. It was good that Michelle gave him more of a story but it was also pretty cliched. Not to mention some awkward scenes like where Noah suddenly models for her art class and takes of his shirt so everyone can gawk at him. We get it you are gorgeous.  The thing is Mara is warned about Noah by her first friend Jamie (who I very much liked so I missed his presence in most parts of the books.) Her initial reactions to Noah are sarcastic replies (loved it) but she soon turns into a sappy girl. Instead of focusing on her real problems she is only fixated by Noah and her hard to get game. I could use less of this romance and more focus on the mystery.  But the real point  what is going on with Mara  was definitely interesting. I cant wait to see how this is going to play out in the other two books.;Michelle Hodkin

And I pretty much know everything after hundreds of yearsexcept for when to take my powers and butt out.I want to help but things just go awry in ways I could never predict.

After I came back from the dead (immortal remember) I tried to play matchmaker for a French prince and ended up banished from France forever. And that little mermaid I found in the Titaniclifeboat I dont even want to think about it.Now a girl named Emma needs me.

Yes there is instantlove but that didnt bother me. Its cute and told in such a sweet way I totally buy it. And let me tell you a secret I believe deep down in love at first sight. Most of the time its just lust but I do believe that it happens sometimes.  Summary.  This story is all about Kendra and the good deeds she has achieved so far. The first part of the book is about her past. She lost her parents sisters and brothers during a plague but she managed to survive and she saved her brother. She took her brother with her to another city. On their way in the woods they stumble on a witch and they are in trouble.  From here on we are told about several stories. The main story is about Emma a girl who lives a happy life with her mother and stepfather. She is a bit lonely and her mother is sometimes pushy when it comes to appearance but her life is fine. That is until Lisette arrives. She is her stepfathers real daughter and the mother recently passed away. This girl is pure evil. She takes over Emmas life and Emma  good naive and sweet as she is  let her do it. Lisette is a true witch. She is a nasty girl who hides her ugly personality behind her gorgeous looks. I wanted to jump into the story to strangle her (and to give Emma a slap in the face to wake her up). When Lisette takes something important from Emma she is going to gain her life back. Things will turn out different than she expected.  There are also two side stories and they are lovely. It was fun to discover which fairytale retelling they were.  Opinion.  Kendra could be my best friend. She is smart sweet and she isnt afraid to be herself. Even when everybody is laughing at her for her clothes she keeps wearing them. Even when everybody is picking on her she will remain silence. Yeah I liked her so much.  Emma is a sweetheart but she is way too naive. She should have listen to her mother but I can also understand some of her choices. She wants to make the best out of the situation and she is trying so hard to fit in. Emma doesnt see how special she is but Im glad she found someone who did.  The writingstyle is flawless. Easy to read fastpaced and clever. Beastly was fun but this one was even better.;Alex Flinn

All these feelings.  I dont cry often for books but Im so close.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  I knew what I was going to read but I never ever thought it would touch me so much as it did. This book gave me all these different feelings. I laughed because of Augustus and Hazels funny humor I felt hopeful because of their strength and I ugly cried because everything is so unfair. Im still not over the beauty of this book. The powerful characters the dazzling writingstyle and the storyline did something to me. Something I cant express in words and I know that I cant do any justice to this book. But I will try.  The first thing that surprised me is Hazel. She was diagnosed with cancer when she was 13 and its a miracle that she is living today as a strong and admirable girl of sixteen years. Her nononsense and blunt way of thinking grabbed me and I instantly liked her. She is trying to make the best out of her situation but I also liked her vulnerable side. It made her so real and honest. I appreciated her moments of a normal teenager. She is rebellious against her parents and she feels smothered by their constant worrying. The way Green portrayed her family was fantastic. Her parents are so caring and protective but they are still trying to give her a normal life.  Her mother forces her to go to the cancer support group but Hazel finds it a waste of time until she meets the love of her life Augustus Waters. I dont think I can describe their connection and love better than Hazel As he read I fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once. They share something special and it blew me away. Hazel and Augustus were made for each other. These two characters are one of the most adorable couple Ive ever seen and they make you believe in true love. They complete each other and I liked the way their feelings grew. The flirty dialogues are slowly transforming to a love everybody is looking for. I completely started to fall in love with Augustus together with Hazel. He is charming humorous and sweet. He is perfection.  They share many beautiful moments so it was hard to see how quickly things changed. Every page I devoured made my heart ache. I wasnt ready for it and I felt shattered when it happened. I think this is what I looked like halfway  gif  It has been a long time since a book made me feel so many things and I finally understand why everybody is praising John Green. Hes a fucking genius. His words are poetic and they flow across the pages. Like I said on my Goodreads status You want to keep reading as fast as possible to see how its going to end. But you also want to let it sink slowly so you can enjoy his beautiful prose.  I honestly wanted to quote every page but I managed to make a selection of two  You gave me a forever within the numbered days and Im grateful.    And then the line was quite but not dead. I almost felt like he was there in my room with me but in a way it was better like I was not in my room and he was not in his but instead we were together in some invisible and tenuous third space that could only be visited on the phone.  I recommend this book to everyone. Im not such a fan of most contemporary books but this book opened my eyes. Just.. read it.;John Green

What a heart breaking book Be prepared for a very dark gritty story with a cruel ending. I literary spent five minutes staring at the last line. How can you end a book like that I need more than this Summers And I missed the answer to how did it start  The zombies were just there appearing out of thin air. These two points lowered the rating to 4.5 still very good.  Let me start by saying that the characters blew me away. Summers know how to create them. Sloane is such a damaged broken person. She has been abused by her father for years and she feels betrayed by her sister. They made these plans together one day they would run away and built a life together. That was until her sister ran away six months ago leaving Sloane under the rage of her father. I cant even think of him that way. He totally terrorizes Sloane. Its even so bad that she is trying to commit suicide but thats when her whole world shatters apart. Zombies are roaming on the streets killing and infection everybody.Sloane ends up with five other teenagers in Cortege High her school building. Trace Rhys Cary Harrison and Grace each of them has their own flaws and problems. I liked how I get to know all of them.  The story is told from Sloanes POV so I really connected with her. Her voice was beautiful. She was strong despite everything and I liked the development she went through.What I also liked was the tension. It was always there making them nervous and annoyed. Harrison is crying all the time Trace and Cary are always fighting and Sloane is waiting for the moment she can give up. The idea that the zombies are all around them was intense especially when they are trying to breach through the barricaded doors. The appearance of one of their teachers adds to the creepy situation and dont get me started about their attempt to leave the building to find another safe haven. I can say that my heart pounded a couple of times.  Conclusion  This is definitely not a standard zombie book and I think its a great book for someone who isnt a fan of them. Its more about the way these teenagers are trying to survive while the world around them is falling apart. Summers has a very pleasant writingstyle and I couldnt put it down. I had to know what was going to happen but the ending was a bit disappointing.  Quotes  Maybe the only way our story can end is varying degrees of sad. And that I miss her that I need her and this kind of missing this kind of need the kind of emptiness it leaves behind is worse than waking up one day and finding the whole world has collapsed in on itself that I was over long before it was.  I never thought anything could feel like the morning I woke up and she was gone but this is what that feels like. It feels exactly like that. I stretch out on the floor and press my face against the cool tiles. I wait for my blood to turn to cement for my heart to stop beating.;Courtney Summers

Its very important that you go into this book with the right expectations. After some reviews I found out that this book is pitched as fantasy but there are not many fantasy elements. This gave me the chance to read this book for what it is an entertaining story that made me curious for more.  Nisha has been abandoned at the gates of the City of a thousand dolls when she was eight years old. This is the place where unwanted girls grow up in order to gain a future. They are placed into one of the Houses (like House of Jade for wisdom or House of flowers for the nobility) where they learn a trade. Other people most of the times males can buy them at the Redeeming. Nisha has never been placed in one of those houses but she grew up as the spy from the Matron the leader of the City. This has given her opportunities to learn all kinds of trades from different houses but it doesnt make her loved. She has two friends but her best friends are the cats. Nisha can talk with them and Jerrit is always there for her. He tries to help her figure out why girls are dying and Nisha must hurry up before she is sold into a life she never wanted.  Be aware that this book is slowpaced. Its a nicely crafted story but the middle part isnt exciting or mindblowing. Its a subtle story that takes its time and I really liked it but its not a story everyone will fall in love with. Most of the book is about Nisha and the mystery around the dead girls. There is a connection and it does take her a lot of time to figure it out. I felt a bit annoyed that she didnt figure it out any sooner but I could also understand why she was blind for the true killer.  Her relationship with the cats most of all Jerrit was adorable I loved their conversations and its very clear they care a lot about Nisha. It was an unique connection and Ive never read a book about such a friendship before. I also had a feeling there was more to it and I was happy that I was right because it gave the story a fairytalelike aspect.  The romance was pretty good. Its on the background and plays an important role in Nishas life. I never liked Devan the way she liked him but the moments they share were cute. It shows how desperate she is to have someone in her life who cares about her. Nisha still feels abandoned by her parents and she doesnt understand how they could have left her. It doesnt make her weak though and she doesnt let herself get overwhelmed by her feelings for Devan.  The concept of the City and those houses was fascinating. Its horrible how the girls are sold but at the same time the Matron does seem to care for the girls. She makes sure they grow up in the right house and the buyers arent so bad. Its at least better than being left to die because there is a twochild policy and a lot of girls are cast away. I liked how every house could be identified by certain specific trademarks.  Nisha was a solid character. She cares for her cats and has a strong loyalty to the people she cares for. I could connect with her and I understood her loneliness. She was sometimes not the brightest (as in looking in all the wrong places to solve the mystery) but all the decisions she makes are made with her heart. She is a good girl and in the end she showed her cleverness in other ways. Her past was fascinating and I loved learning more about it.  If you dont mind a slowpace book with an interesting setting and cats you might want to check this out.;Miriam Forster

The strongest are born again. We only keep the scars we choose to keep.  If your looking for a book that is made by kneading together various fairytales then your search is over. This story was so much fun We have the happy family consisting of four daughters (Wednesday Friday Saturday and Sunday) a son called Peter and an adopted son Trix. There used to be seven daughters and a son called Jack but you will have to find out about them yourself.  Sunday is the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter and therefore she is doomed to live a happy life. Her talent is writing. Unfortunately everything she writes down has the tendency to come true. One day Sunday meets a frog. They become friends until she breaks the curse that was placed upon Rumbold the prince. He returns to his palace and he announces a ball. Her family hates the Royal Family and Rumbold wants to make sure that Sunday falls in love with him as a person not only as a frog.  Troubles are starting when the King lays his eyes on Wednesday. He reminds her of his true love the fairy godmother Sorrow. The king and Sorrow have a gruesome plan in order to keep his youth and power. Rumbold must do anything to rescue Wednesday before it is too late.  Opinion.  She needed him to keep her sane to make her laugh to feel complete.  I love how every character got their own personality. Besides Sunday I really appreciated Saturday. She is a woodsman like her father and she hates dancing and the fancy balls. At the end of the book she is even trying to learn how to handle a sword  Sunday is a sweet girl and she will do anything to keep her family safe. It was nice to see how happy this family is despite the losses they have suffered. They have their struggles but they love each other anyway.  I didnt really connect with Rumbold (therefore 4.5 instead of 5 hearts) but he was a good match to Sunday. Their love blossoms when they meet as a girl and a frog isnt that great  The storyline is awesome and the plot is wonderful. It was so much fun to figure out all the fairytales The use of those stories is perfectly executed. The writingstyle is fast paced the worldbuilding is good and I couldnt stop reading this book. I cant wait to read more from this author.;Alethea Kontis

I did see most of the twists coming but it was fun D    httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  What an interesting book. Its slightly disturbing and creepy but also refreshing. Its different from anything Ive read this year and I really liked it. Be aware that there is violence against animal in the form of experiments. I cant imagine why someone is against this in books  its a story after all  but at least Ive warned you. I havent read the original story but it might be fun to give it a shot now. I cant wait to see the similarity between these books.  Maybe we werent wicked but there was something stained something torn in the fabric of our being.  Summary.  Juliets mother passed away and she is now trying to survive by cleaning the laboratory after animal experiments. As a girl there is no way she can study with the boys to have a chirurgic future. But she isnt just a regular lady. Her father was a famous surgeon before a huge scandal destroyed his future. He disappeared from her life but he left her with a lot of information about biology and experiments. When Juliet hears rumours about her father she decided to gain more information and that is how she finds Montgomery. She grew up with him and he tells her about her father he is now living on an abandoned island practicing new experiments. Juliet is desperate to escape her life and she travels with Montgomery. On their way they find a man on sea called Edward.  Juliet is now thrown into the madness of her fathers mind. What is going on with all the strange vivisections and the deformed humans  Opinion.  Vivisections I think its horrible to do something like that to an animal but it was interesting to read about. Especially with the mad mind of Juliets father. He is a twisted genius who tries to show he is equal to God and it gives a lot of excitement in this book. There are some scary situations when her father loses control over his experiments. A monster is roaming around and Juliet is starting to worry about her life. I had some heartpounding moments and that has been a while. I loved it This story is quite messedup and the side characters are fascinating.  I was also invested in Juliets story. Abandoned by her father after his bad reputation alone after her mothers dead its not easy for her. She is far too intelligent determined and free for this time period and I admire her spirit. I could connect with her she wants to learn and she is interested in biology. Im not easily disgusted like her because of my study. (example I had to do a section on a rat. He died humane) I didnt care for the lovetriangle. She is very easy when it comes to love and I didnt feel the connection between any of the characters. She and Montgomery were the most likeable together since they have a past but love Nope.  The writingstyle is pleasant. Its fast easy and descriptive. It wasnt hard to get swept away and I saw everything around me  which was quite terrifying now and then. The ending was good. Closed but Im also looking forward to the next book.;Megan Shepherd

I think I enjoyed this book more because of the negative buzz. After seeing ratings varying from 1 to 2 stars my expectations went down very quickly. Im glad that I was able to enjoy it a little more. I was thinking about 2.5 flowers but in the end I still settled down with 3 flowers despite the flaws.  The book is mostly about Regan whose father is the great mastermind behind Elusion. This is a dreamscape world where people can hide when they want to forget their real life for a moment. You hook yourself up to some special devices and you are good to go. For one hour you can be someone else somewhere else. But Regan isnt in the mood for escaping after her fathers death. The after effects intensify her loss and she has been too busy supporting Patrick who is following into her fathers footsteps. Her life is starting to get even more complicated when she hears rumors about Elusion and its negative effects. When she meets Josh she believes its time to hunt down the truth.  I loved the concept of this book and the world they were trying to create. The idea of escaping with technology sounds fascinating. I also liked the reason behind Elusion and the grim portrayal of the world was nicely done with O2 screens and acid rain. The problems with Elusion and the discovering of the firewall was interesting but at the same time not unexpected. I could see the twist coming and its not strange that there will be problems. Its understandable that its addictive and I dont get why its so surprising for people. Regan defends Elusion but there are hormones released with the stimulation. It doesnt take a scientist to understand that it will have effect on the human body despite the special technology they were using.  So that brings me right to my main problem with this book. Regan. This girl was at times stupid and naive. I hated how she threw herself on a boy she hardly knows (Josh) and how she always defends Patrick when he is an obvious douche. He lies and manipulates Regan and she accepts it. Its also strange how easily she trusts Josh when she was such a firm believer of Elusion. Only a couple of words from Josh and she is ready to find evidence to bring Elusion down. The somewhat lovetriangle wasnt necessarily at all. There was no chemistry. I think that the PatrickJosh ship has more potential  and they hate each others guts.  The only thing I want to say as last is that this book has a good potential. The basics of this story could have turned into a wonderful tale but it became a predictable story with okay characters. I still thought it was enjoyable enough to make me curious about the next book but there is some work to do.;Claudia Gabel Cheryl Klam

First thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing the ARC as an ebook to me. I really tried to love this one. The synopsis sounds great and Ive read some positive reviews about this book. Unfortunately there were to many things I didnt like.  The story tells about our heroin Seraphina (nice name by the way). She is sixeen years old and lives in a world with humans and dragons. The dragons have the ability to transform their bodies into human forms so they can walk amongst them. There was a war between humans and dragons them but for forty years there has been peace because they signed a treaty.  They want to sign the treaty again but a member of the royal family has been murdered and everything makes it appears to be the work of a dragon. Like his head is missing and thats significant for draconian fashion.  Seraphina comes in the middle of the investigation and she must assist Prince Lucian Kiggs to discover the murderer. There is only one problem she is half human half dragon. Her mother was a dragon and she must hide that part of herself before she and her father are killed. Humans are still not very fond of dragons and the times are very dangerous now.  Let me tell you about the things I liked.  Seraphina was a great character. She has a passion for music she is intelligent and I loved her sense of humor. Her love story was very believable for me. It really developed and I could feel the connection between her and Lucian. There are a lot of other great characters. They were a bit bizarre and that makes them so wonderful. I especially liked Orma  but I wouldnt want him to hear that if he was alive because I think he would kill me for it. The world building was amazing. The fact that dragons can transform their appearance to humans was a nice addition.  The things I didnt liked.  Although I think Seraphina is a wonderful girl I didnt connect with her. It felt like I was reading her story I didnt feel it. I wish I could bond some more with her.  That leads me to the second point I never had the feeling I was sucked in the story. It wasnt hard for me to stop reading. I never reached the point where I just wanted to know the ending and I didnt regret the fact that I was done with this book. The story has a nice pace but I just wished it was a bit shorter.;Rachel Hartman

Finally a dystopian book with a good worldbuilding. We get a lot of background story without an information dump. The world slowly unravels in the book and I liked how believable it was. The human race is dying after the war against the Partials and the release of the RM virus. Only a part of the human race was immune and they are together on Long Island where they live with the constant treat of attack from Partials or the resistance group called The Voice.  Kira is a young medicintraining. The mandatory pregnancy law must help to rebuild their world but there hasnt been an immune baby for years. Kira takes a dangerous step when she finds out that her friend is pregnant she wants to catch Partial. These engineered organic beings are immune for the RM virus and they can be the answer to finding a cure. Together with a small group they manage to catch a Partial but the government isnt happy with her. She has five days to study him before they kill him. While Kira is racing against she clock she is starting to learn valuable information. Information that makes her question the only world she has ever known.  There are several things I absolutely loved in this book.  1. Like I said in the beginning the worldbuilding. I never had the feeling that I was reading something unrealistic and it wasnt hard to understand. I highly enjoyed this setting and I cant wait to return.  2. The biologicalmedical aspect of this book. I think this is a lovehate situation but this fits to my interests. I havent read anything like this in a book before. I liked the scientific data and research about the RM virus. Yes some things are a bit hard to believe (Kira is a medicintraining and sixteen years old but she is talking like someone who has been researching for years) but I found this very interesting and enjoyable.  3. The characters especially Kira. She is smart strong and brave. She was capable of making clever choices and she is willing to sacrifice herself to rescue her friends baby.  4. No overwhelming romances Im getting tired of this trend and Im happy that it didnt happen in Partials. Yes there is some romance between Kira and her boyfriend Marcus but it is always on the background. Say goodbye to the instalove and the lovetriangles it is all about the research for a cure.  5. The ending. It makes me excited for the next book but there is no torturous cliffhanger.  It did take me some time to get sucked into the story. It was about halfway (from the moment she is investigating Samm) when I really started to like this story but I couldnt put it down once I reached that point.;Dan Wells

Katniss should be relieved but now there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol  a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.As the nation watches Katniss and Peeta the stakes are higher than ever. One false move and the consequences will be unimaginable.;480;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1327087419m12510082.jpg;Catching Fire (The Hunger Games 2);youngadult;Also to be found on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Summary.  Because sometimes things happen to people and theyre not equipped to deal with them.  The Hunger Games are back. Every twenty five year they celebrate the games in a different way. Just an example the year that Haymitch won was the year where every district had to deliver four candidates.  Katniss and Peeta are in trouble. In almost every district there is tension. There are rumors of rebellion. Katniss is afraid for the lives of everybody she loves because Snow blames her for the rebellion. And it shows this time every district must deliver a survivor of a Hunger Game. That means that Katniss is up for another round and Peeta decides to take place as the male candidate. Katniss is sure that she is going to die and she is prepared to do everything to keep Peeta alive. What she doesnt know is that Haymitch has another plan. He makes connections with other survivors with only one goal keep her and therefore Peeta alive. No matter what.  The Hunger Games begin. The environment is terrible. In the middle the horn. Surrounded by salt water and a jungle. Everything is placed in a perfect circle. They are in a real life clock. Every area has deadly tricks and they switch every hour clockwise. Like poisonous air monkeys and rain made out of blood.  If you die and I live theres no life for me at all back in district twelve. Youre my whole life he says. I would never be happy again.  Katniss and her teammates made a plan but it doesnt work out. There is chaos everywhere. The whole area seems to explode and Katniss is unconscious until she wakes up in some kind of hospital. She is in a hovercraft and she finds out what Haymitch has done. She must life because she is the sign of the rebellion. She is the Mockingjay.  They are bringing her to district thirteen. Peeta is taken by The Capitol and Katniss falls into a depression. Until one day Gale appears on her bed. He is wounded and tells her a devastating story. He rescued her mother and sister in time for they destroyed district twelve completely. Theres rebellion everywhere.  Opinion.  I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I thought the first one was pretty good but this one blew me away I never thought she would come up with something like this. Its so cruel and sickly smart to send Katniss back. Its the ultimate master plan. Just let her die there and nobody can blame the President.  I liked the fact that there is more action in this one. There is more speed in the story. Everything happens fast and that makes it more pleasant than the first one. The area is brilliant. This is what I mean with a tough area. In the Hunger Games they had it quite easy overall. Here its really hard to survive. And the whole clock idea was a clever invention.  The characters in this book were so nice. Not that you get enough time to bond with them since they die within every page but they were brave and nice. Even a bit silly but I like that. I especially liked Finnick and I got more feeling for Peeta but he is still not my favorite.;Suzanne Collins

A revolution is unfolding and everyone it seems has had a hand in the carefully laid plans  everyone except Katniss.And yet she must play the most vital part in the final battle. Katniss must become their Mockingjay  the symbol of rebellion  no matter what the personal cost.;458;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1327089826m12512617.jpg;Mockingjay (The Hunger Games 3);youngadult;Also in httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  The end. I always hate to end series because you get to know the characters so good they almost become friends.  And if we burn you burn with us  Katniss is in district 13. She is depressed and feels awul about the fact that Peeta has been capture by the Capitol. When the first interview with Peeta pops up he seems fine and Katniss decides to play the role of the Mockingjay. He is asking for a cease fire and that makes him a traitor.  The second interview shows a different Peeta. He is tired very skinny and he seems to be in a lot of pain. He speaks directly to her are you sure Can you trust the rebels enough Do they tell you everything He warns them for the bombs. Right after that they go deeper in the ground and they are just in time to escape the bombs. Katniss feels terrible. How can she live and be the Mockingjay when her friend suffers because of her President Coin decides to free Peeta and the other rebels in The Capitol because Katniss cant function. She is so down that her propos are terrible but the rescue only makes things worse. Peeta is hijacked with Tracker Jacker venom and theyve created a monster he sees Katniss as the enemy.  Katniss decides to enter a special team to take over the Capitol. They must be careful since the whole area is like a Hunger Game full of horror like poisonous venom. A lot of people die even someone I grow to be very fond of Finnick. I felt like crying when he died. After Haymitch he was my favorite character. Strong and adorable. At the same time I felt so bad for Annie. There love was cute  When they are near the Capitol Katniss sees her sister Prim right before District 13  while they make everybody believes its the Capitol  drops their bombs. Prim dies before her eyes and that really stung me. She became such a brave girl a lot like Katniss in the beginning. In the first book she was just a little girl but shes all grown up now. Suzanne Collins didnt spare her characters.  The Capitol is overthrown and Snow is captured. Katniss decides to pay him a last visit and he plants new thoughts in her head. She decides its time to change things. On the execution day she shoots President Coin right in her heart and Snow dies during his laughter. I imagined how that will look like in the movie. Someone laughing so hard that he chockes in it.  She and Peeta are living together. Gale ends up with a nice job. Her mother lives in District 12 a medical district from now on. Its a totally different ending than I expected but I think it really fits the story. The only thing I really disliked is the fact that Katniss has lost her courage. I really didnt recognize her this way and her bravery was one of the things I liked about her.. I appreciate Peeta more than before but I still dont feel the real love between them. Its almost like Katniss isnt capable of feeling such thing for a guy and hes too sweet for her.  I think Id rather see Katniss alone. I know that its not romantic but her love for Gale was based on an old friendship and the love for Peeta was because of the Hunger Games. They suffered together and that gave a special bond but I dont feel the burning passion between them. It felt like Harry Potter and Hermione Granger.  Overall the series is great but this book was definitely not the best one. I was a bit bored sometimes. Reading about a sad Katniss who seems to sleep all the time suffering in silence.;Suzanne Collins

For now.When her mothers mental health takes a turn for the worse Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on.

Edit 4 stars it is.  Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Summary  Alyssas mother has been locked away in a special institute. They are descendants from the Alice in Wonderland and every woman suffers from the same mental problem. They hear insects and flowers talk. When Alyssa is starting to hear the voices too she is worried that she might end up like her mother. Her father is so desperate that he wants to use electronic pulses. When her mother tells her about a family curse that can be broken Alyssa decides to find the rabbit hole.  That is how she ends up in Wonderland with her best friend and crush Jeb. Morpheus  an old forgotten friend  explains that she must undo all the mistakes Alice made. This is the start of a huge adventure with unexpected twists crazy characters and dangerous situations. Be aware to dive into the madness.  Review  The story.  I loved the whole concept of the family curse but the twists made it even better. There were so many things I never expected. When you think you finally know what is going on you are wrong. This story constantly went in different directions. The unpredictability made it exciting. Its a shame I cant tell you more about it but that would spoil the fun of finding out yourself.  Next point is the darkness in Wonderland. The worldbuilding is amazing and I loved the creepy atmosphere throughout the book. It reminded me of the game Alice in Madness. The descriptions helped me to make a picture in my head and I felt like I walked besides Alyssa in this messed up world.  The characters.  This is the point where I had some troubles. Alyssa is a good solid character. I liked her strange hobby making art with dead insects. She was strong and brave. I admired her for going into Wonderland to save her mother. She was also a bit naive and Jeb could walk right over her. That brings me to his character whom I absolutely hate.  I couldnt see the connection between him and Alyssa. There are so many things wrong with him. He is acting like he is a good friend but he makes sure that Alyssa cant join him to London because his girlfriend comes with him. London is supposed to be a project for school so who is he to tell her father to keep her at home He doesnt believe in her he is constantly nagging that she isnt capable of this or that she is too weak to do that. Just have a little faith her in Alyssa is defending him all the time while he actually acts like a douche bag. And I just cant overlook the fact that he has a ponytail.  So on to Morpheus who was a wonderful character. He never pretends to be someone else he knows that is manipulative. He knows that he is lying and cheating. He knows that his master plan is working and that he puts Alyssa on the wrong foot. The fact that he is aware of that makes him awesome. He is a genius and the brain behind all the great twists. He also has a gentle side and I could see why Alyssa was attracted to him in those moments. These two different clashing personalities make him interesting and complex.  We also get to meet a lot of other characters I dont even know where to begin. Let me just say that Howard uses a huge amount of creatures and characters in this book. They all have their purpose and own voice. It was great to meet them and I admire the way she created them.  Conclusion  Give me part two Unhinged Despite the fact that I disliked Jeb I fell in love with the dark Wonderland and its creepy inhabitants. I hope to see more of Morpheus because his complexity makes him fascinated. This book would make one hell of a movie  No one knows what he or she is capable of until things are at their darkest.;A.G.

Things were looking up.And then he opened his mouth.Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stabworthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand well something... unexpected happens.The hot alien living next door marks me.You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities and Daemons touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way Im getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades.If I dont kill him first that is.;335;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1328275091m12578077.jpg;Obsidian (Lux 1);fantasy paranormal;Obsidian (Lux Novel) Hmm I liked the witty dialogue between Kathy and Daemon in the beginning but it started to get a bit.. boring. I wanted to smack their heads together TO KISS ALREADY. I liked this book but it doesnt stand out to me. Ill continue the series though because it was entertaining enough. It actually felt like a better written version of Twilight..  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2....  Im going to be honest and tell you right away that Ive been ignoring this book because I hate the cover. There I said it. I actually hate the covers from the entirely series. The only reason I decided to read this book after all is because of the Paranormal challenge. I hardly read any alien books (this is actually my fist one ever as far as I know) and this book got some good ratings. I wasnt too disappointed but I dont get all the fuss either. Nothing too spectacular or new but definitely entertaining.  Summary.  Katys father died 3 years ago and her mother is now ready to start a new life. They move to another city where Katy becomes the neighbor of the mysterious Daemon and Dee. From the moment they meet Daemon acts like a complete douche. Dee and Katy soon become friend but Daemon is always trying to interfere. There is something strange going on and Katy is set on finding out what. She never suspected that her new friends would be aliens and they bring a lot of danger with them.  Opinion.  For a first alien book it wasnt so bad. I must say that I never felt attracted to the topic but I think I might like it. It was refreshing to see something different than the other Paranormal creatures. I will definitely go and try some other alien books now (The 5th wave is high on my list and if you have other suggestions let me know)There is some action in this book with all the dark enemies lurking around the corner. This spiced up the story which actually is all about Daemon and Katy. Their dynamics were fun in the beginning. They are always quarreling and Daemon is sometimes frustrating but I started to get bored. There was a certain point where it just needed to stop and where I wanted more like information about the aliens.  I liked Katy. I wasnt blown away by her personality but she is a book blogger (credits) and I like how she stood up for herself. She knows how to handle Daemon and she has a way with words. She is pretty fearless at some point and she even saves his life. Daemon is of course dangerously attractive. I like how protective he is when it comes to family. Dee is sweet. She hungers for a normal life with friends and fun. The enemy was interesting and I hope to find more information in the next book. The ending was good enough to make me continue this series.;Jennifer L. Armentrout

This is something you need to read whe you are in the same mood as me something funny and easy dont think to hard about it.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book was fun. Im actually surprised I liked it so much since there isnt much story when I think about it. The middle part is mostly about teenager hormones but it was enjoyable. I think this book matched the mood I had something easy fluffy and funny.  The first thing that made me excited about this book (and no Im not talking about the incredible cover) is the Egyptian mythology  and to my surprise we also get some Greek. I like mythology and I havent seen many YA books with Egyptian gods so bonus points for that. I liked that every chapter starts with some information so there is no huge infodump.  In this book Isadora is the shining star. She is someone you easily start to like especially because of her teenager spirit. She struggles with the fact that she is the mortal daughter of two immortal Gods. Her feelings were understandable and I think its logical that she wants freedom. So when her mother (Isis) sends her to her brother because she feels danger Isadora is more than happy. Until she finds out that her mother got her a volunteer job but its not that bad in the end. She makes friends with Tyler (girl) Scott (Tylers boyfriend) and Ry.  Isadora develops subtle and I liked the influence of her friends. She tries to push Ry away but it only makes him come closer. There is no instalove here (yeay) and they are a great match. You got to like Ry who is different  in a good way. He is always writing in his notebook (poetry how romantic) and he is a bit goofy. This makes up for the fact that he has flawless looks. White doesnt portray him as perfect and that is great.  This isnt a book with much plot and it quickly unravels at the end with an interesting twist. Its more about friendship love and finding yourself. Normally that would have bothered me but Whites writingstyle made up for it. It has a humorous tone and its light and easy. Perhaps its just because I was in a fluffly mood but it worked for me. [Although its one of the reasons this book has a 3star rating]  What I disliked was the fact that Isadoras mother gets a baby every 20 years. WHY I still dont understand it.. I can see why Isadora believes that she is unloved because her mother is a walking baby factory. Taking a child every 20 years is almost like replacing the old ones with a new play toy. Why would you torment yourself with losing a child all over again I believe it has something to do with being worshiped to stay strong but it strikes me as rather odd.  If you dont expect much more of this book than a fluffy read youre good to go.;Kiersten White

Seeing Meghan Puck Grimalkin and Ash made me realize how much I missed them. I hope they will play a bigger role next time. You cant have too much Puck and Grimalkin  Summary.  Ethan is not a normal teenager. His halfsister is queen of the iron Fey and he is cursed with the Sight. Which practically means that the faeries are ruining his life. In order to keep a low profile from the faeries he tries to stay away from people. There is only one girl who isnt scared by his bad temper Mackenzie also known as Kenzie.

Ethan keeps seeing faeries he never saw before  what are they and what are they doing here When Ethan ignores a warning from one of them the real trouble starts. He ends up in Nevernever together with Kenzie.  He finally meets Meghan again and when she doesnt listen to him Ethan decides that he must find Todd before it is too late. Together with Keirran a halfelf Razor a gremlin and Kenzie he embarks on a difficult journey to find out who these Forgotten are  and what they are doing to the disappearing exiles and halfbreeds.  Opinion.  First of all we all know that Kagawa knows how to write a good story. The worldbuilding is great. It always felt like I was walking besides Ethan and his new made friends. She also knows how to create believable characters and a good male POV. I totally understood Ethans bitterness even when he sometimes went too far in his hate. He is blinded by his anger for Meghan but he slowly starts to open up for the world that is part of him.  Now before I start screaming will someone  you or the talking cat or a freaking flying goat I dont care  please tell me what the hell is going on  Kenzie was great She is brave and an equal match for Ethan. I did question her behaviour sometimes but it became clear at the end. I love how their feelings got enough time to develop so dont be scared about instantlove (and thank you Kagawa no lovetriangle)  I cant write this review without mentioning Razor the gremlin. What a cutie You just have to love this little guy. The Forgotten are very creepy and unique. They made a great plot even when the pace was a bit slow sometimes.  Conclusion it was a good start from a new series but definitely not the best book from the iron Fey so far. Im looking forward to the next book.;Julie Kagawa

Or boys. Look at the horror on his face. He doesnt look like a people person.  My first book in 2013 is a fact. Ive won this book a while ago and I like that the main characters name is Mel I liked this girl She is smart she is doing well in school she is loyal to her friends and she has a fantastic sense of humour. It was so much fun to read this book told from her POV. I could connect with her and she made me laugh out loud a couple of times.  She has a best friend named Cathy an exboyfriend called Ty and another friend Anna who has been absent after her father left her and her mother for a vampire. Vampires are nothing special since New Whitby has a place for them The Shade. When one of the vampires sign up for their school Cathy is fascinated by him. Mel hates him right away and she cant stand the fact that Francis becomes a part of their group. When Cathy and Francis fall in love Mel is desperate to keep Cathy away from him. Her plan doesnt go that well but that is how a boy with a strange story Kit arrives in the story.  Mel is also trying to find out more about Annas father. Her mother is acting strange and she cant believe that her loving father just left her. When Mel starts to discover many secrets together with Kit  a boy she really starts to like  she is plunged into a dangerous mystery. Can she stop Cathy from becoming one of the Undead and can she unravel the mystery around Annas father  While I really liked Mel I wanted to smack Cathy most of the time. She is a girl with an old soul and that is why she connects with Francis. She is supposed to be very clever according to her perfect grades but she lacks of intelligence when it comes to love. Wanting to become a vampire after falling in love so soon (They only know each other for two weeks) I did like Kit. He is so sweet and naive because he knows so little about humans.  Another thing I appreciated about this book was the normal family. Mel has a brother called Lancelot and two happily married normal functioning parents. Im happy to see that they still exist in books. It was refreshing to see someone who wants to stay way from vampires because they are bloodsuckers despite their gorgeous looks. If you like vampires and you want something else I definitely recommend this book.;Sarah Rees Brennan Justine Larbalestier

She is going to visit the city where she and her parents lived before they died in a fire. Her godmothers arent planning on taking her there  because of the bad memories so she decides to go on a trip herself. When she arrives there its not what she expected. She cant rent a room and she ends up in some kind of restaurant in a casino staring at her cold fries. Two boys appear Blue and Freddie. He sends her away. Apparently his father owns the place and he says its not save for her to be there.  She meets another boy. Its the brother of Blue  Felix. He takes her back to the casino and he gives her a room. The next morning she awakes by a bang on the door. Blue breaks into her room with Freddie and he is angry. Again he tells her its not save for her and the takes her away to bring her to another place where she can stay. Hes taking her to someone called Viv.  Viv is the first fairytale character Mira meets. When they are in the Gingerbread restaurant to get something to eat we get to know more characters. There is some kind of curse everybody is talking about and Mira is confused.  When Mira is on the beach with the whole gang  even though she keeps repeating how awful Blue is that she doesnt like him and that he must leave  she notices something strange. Blue and Felix both have a red spot on their back precisely where she has the same mark. What does that mean Its the beginning of a huge discovery.  Mira.. What can I say about her Naive stupid annoying That would be the words I would like to describe her.

I needed to get Mirabrat out of the hotel. Felix latched on to her and she thinks hes dreamy.  In the end I liked the way Sarah used popular and unknown fairytales to make an original story.

Predictable and whiny. Review coming soon.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book.. Where do I start I really wish I could love this series as much as everybody else but there is something I dislike. This story just doesnt work for me so Im happy to finish it now. This book was definitely the worst one in the series although its not a bad ending to a trilogy. It was satisfying but the way to the end was boring and made up out of three parts  The first part is whiny. Vincents spirit is absorbed by Violette (without the Champion power) and she has burned his body. Its perfectly understandable that Kate is sad but she doesnt have to sob and feel sorry for herself every damn page. I get it can we continue with the story please She is trying to search for a way to bring Vincent back but he is a whiner telling her its no use. He tries to comfort her by saying that his spirit will always be around her. Im not sure but that would really upset me. Then the most lame thing ever happens of course.  [GIF]  The second is the middle of this book and perhaps the worst part. I wanted to skip this completely but I was afraid I might miss something  I didnt. Its boring and unnecessarily. There is a strong Numa gathering an army and the only thing they care about is telling how much they love each other.  [GIF]  And when I finally came to the last part we have the predictability and this made me role my eyes several times.You can see this one coming from the start  but its ridiculous. I hated it and it was definitely a oh no not again situation. There is no originality here. The ending wrapped the story nicely and that was perhaps the only thing I liked together with the secondary characters.  Because the MCs are clearly not my favorites. I dont care about Vincent. He is there and that is it. Kate.. Oh boy. Let me say that I wasnt a fan of her in the other books but this was even worse. I think this quote in the whiny part tells you everything you need to know  A compartment inside my heart that had gradually over the last nine months become a huge Vincentshaped space was suddenly and violently empty.  Another problem I had was the writingstyle. I dont recall having difficulties with this in the other books but there was something off. It felt choppy and that made it hard to feel absorbed by the story. Let me give you an example  Now my hatred had a face. A name. And I felt its venom burning in my veins. It actually felt good. Because when I focused on revenge it made me forget my despair.  Oh well I have another series I can stripe of the list Unfinished series I made a while ago.;Amy Plum

Welcome to Wentworth hall where the Darlingtons have lived for generations. There is only one problem they are completely broke and Lord Darlington knows one solution. He must marry his oldest daughter Maggie to a rich guy. Maggie just returned from a vacation in France where she harbored a secret which can ruin her life. She is trying to ignore her feelings for Michael the groom in order to trick Teddy into a marriage. Teddy and his sister Jessica are recently orphaned and they must wait for their inheritance until they turn eighteen.  I had some troubles with Maggie especially before I knew her secret. She is snobby and unpleasant to be around with. She acts like she cares about nothing and she is so emotionless. Its hard to connect with her and the old stories about how spirited she was meant nothing to me. I did warmed up for her in the end.  Teddy and Jessica are the perfect example of rich people. They truly believe they are better than anyone else and they are mean to everyone below their station. There is also the overlooked daughter Lila who is lonely now Maggie changed. She is out shined and tries everything to get attention from Teddy. I felt sorry for this girl and her constant hunger for attention and love.  The return of brother Wesley brings new tension because someone is spreading their secrets by writing a story about Worthless hall in a newspaper. Can they discover the culprit before it is too late I liked this bit of mystery and how the articles are included in the story. It was funny to read about them through the eyes of someone else. I had two suspicions and it was nicely done.  Overall not a bad story. The setting was good the characters were interesting and I like how everything wrapped up.;Abby Grahame

But you cant get away from a thing thats your own fault.  From the beginning I was sucked into the story of Callie. She lives in Slow Run with her mother in a small hotel. The constant storms are causing health problems for Callie but her mother refuses to leave. Year ago their father left them but he promised to return one day and her mother is holding tight to that promise.  When one of the worst dust storms comes up Callies mother disappears. That is when Callie starts to find out that she isnt just a girl. She is part of a prophecy and the two Faerie courts  Seelie and Unseelie  are both looking for her. Together with Jack a boy she releases out of jail Callie is heading for the golden hills of the west California. Her parents are supposed to be there and she will do anything to safe her mother. On their way they encounter dangerous people and its hard to find out who they can trust.  I really liked Callie. She has a hard time with the dust but she keeps supporting her mother. Im not really sure if her mother deserves that but her loyalty was touching. It was fun to collect all the pieces of the puzzle with her. Why is she hearing all these strange voices and what is the mystery around her father Jack is a sweet boy but I didnt really connect with him. He was just there and I like that he decides to help Callie a girl he barely met. The secondary characters are interesting and I like how they played their role in the story. There are some creepy characters and it was a shame that the real villain was overshadowed.  The ending was a bit too rushed for my taste. I didnt see the twist coming but I wished that the plot got more time to unravel. A few pages more would have completed this story but Im definitely looking forward to part two Golden Girl which will be published June 25th.;Sarah Zettel

But in order to reach Westfalin Petunia must pass through a forest where strange twolegged wolves are rumored to exist. Wolves intent on redistributing the wealth of the noble citizens who have entered their territory. But the banditwolves prove more rakishly handsome than truly dangerous and its not until Petunia reaches her destination that she realizes the kindly grandmother she has been summoned to visit is really an enemy bent on restoring an ageold curse. The stories of Red Riding Hood and Robin Hood get a twist as Petunia and her many sisters take on bandits grannies and the new King Under Stone to end their family curse once and for all.;326;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1397879349m12873027.jpg;Princess of the Silver Woods ( The Princesses of Westfalin Trilogy  3);fantasy paranormal;Again a lovely story  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This was such an adorable series. I like how all the books can be read as standalones (although I highly suggest to read them in order to fully understand the story. Many things in this book refer to earlier situations in Princess of the midnight ball.) The original blend of Red riding hood and Robin Hood was entertaining.  Summary.  This book tells the story of the youngest princess Petunia. She is on her way to visit an elderly friend and prince Grigori when she is kidnapped by a banditwolf. This is actually Olivier an earl whos land and possessions have been taken away after the war. He steals from the rich to provide money for his people who are hiding away in an abandoned house somewhere in the forest.  When Olivier finds out that Petunia is one of the princesses he knows he is in trouble. He takes her to the estate and in the evening strange shadows crawl up the wall to Petunias room and one of them threatens to kill Olivier. He is afraid for Petunias life and he warns the king even when he knows he might die for his actions. Her sisters and husbands free him and together they return to help Petunia. They dont know that they walk right into the trap from the King under stone because he is back and he wants to claim them as wives for his brothers like promised.  Review.  I was happy to see more of the King under stone. It makes this book exciting and I kept reading to find out what was going to happen. The nightmares and shadowy figures are only the beginning and the princesses are in real trouble.  The only thing I found less interesting in this book is Petunia. She has spunk (she almost shot Olivier when they first met) but she is a bit naive and she doesnt shine like the other princesses. I really liked Poppy in Princess of glass so I was happy that she was present in this book. She made this book work for me. Its a shame that there wont be any more stories because Id be interested to see some more about Lily.  Olivier is not bad. I liked his role as Robin Hood and its cute how he wants to take care of Petunia. He even wants to sacrifice his own life by warning the king. His role in this book was therefore very important. He also brings a group of man together among them is Galen to take care of the King under stone for once and for all. The romance between Petunia and Olivier is a bit fast but that was something I expected from the beginning. Its not instalove though and it was fun to see it develop. They were sweet together.  All together a fantastic ending to this series and I recommend it to fairy tale lovers or people who are looking for a blend of romance and paranormal.;Jessica Day George

But Katniss has been close to death before. For her survival is second nature.May the odds be ever in your favour.;454;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1327089453m12885649.jpg;The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games 1);youngadult;Is going to be published on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  If you havent read this book  and I think that is almost impossible. I really feel like the last person on earth who just read this book for the first time  there are spoilers.  We get to meet Katniss who lives with her mother and sister Prim in district twelve. She is very good with bow and arrows. Hunting is the only way to provide her family with food and money. Every year there are The Hunger Games. These are hosted to remind the people what happened years ago. There was a rebellion against the Capitol and district thirteen was extinguished. Years of hunger and suffer followed. Its also entertainment for the rich people who live in the Capitol.  During the Hunger Games every district must provide one boy and one girl. They must battle against each other until there is one winner. When Katniss sister is chosen Katniss volunteers in her place. Peeta is the chosen boy. Before the Hunger Games really start they get a mentor a crew for their appearance and teachers. District twelve is not very popular and there are not many survivors during the years. Their mentor is Haymitch. He is drunk harsh and in the beginning you expect him to be useless. We also get to know Cinna her stylist and Effie.  The Hunger Games begin and in the first minutes a lot of people die. Then there is a change in rules from now on a girl and a boy from the same district can win the Hunger Games. This is because Peeta and Katniss played the role of lovers. She finds Peeta and he is wounded almost dying. Her feelings for him become very complicated. She must play the role of a girl who is madly in love but how does she really feels about him  In the end they manage to survive both and then they find out that the rule is changed again. There can only be one winner.. They decide to do something that really bothers the Capital they want to take deadly berries so there will be no winner. The host avoids their plan and they both win the Games. From now on they are rich and in danger. The Capital is not happy with them. Their action can hold more consequences than they ever imagined.  What I really liked about this book are the characters and the use of technology. Katniss is a tough girl but she has a soft side and that gave her a real personality. Peeta was not my favorite but thats also because he was a whiny boy in the movie. I think that I like Gale more. I dont know why but I liked Haymitch from the beginning. I felt a certain sympathy for him. Imagine his role in The Hunger Games. Coaching a girl and a boy and seeing them die every year.  And about the technology thats more because Ive seen the movie. I thought that the scenes behind the screen added something essential to the story. Seeing how they can change the landscape to manipulate the participants. Creating monsters to give the audience a spectacular finally. The strength of this book is the reflection to our lives. Its true everybody wants to see more blood and action.  Look at the programs on television where people do these crazy things for money. Nothing is silly enough. We always try to cross the line. Just push the limits a bit further. How many years before we host our own Hunger Games Thinking about it makes me sick but I dont think that something like that is off limits.. When we always want more where will we end someday Watching people butcher each other for money and excitement Im frightened for the future sometimes.  I still wonder why this book is SUCH a hype. Its fantastic indeed but why is this particular book so popular At least Im happy that its about a very good book instead of some other hypes we have had. And I know that you know what Im talking about );Suzanne Collins

I recently won a copy of Scarlet and Ill be getting Lady Thief soon so it was a perfect timing Im very happy to rediscover this book and my love for it. Not to mention the fact that Im ashamed for my previous review so Im more than happy to write another one.  This book shines when it comes to characters. They are fleshed out and they all grew on me. Lets get started with Scarlet a kickass girl who pretends to be a boy. She has a strong mind is intelligent fierce and has a way with words. She suffers from guilt about things that happened in the past and she tries to sacrifice everything for others. Her secret prevents her from being completely honest to her boys and she often shuts them out. I liked how she stood up for herself and she has crazy skills with her knives. This is a character I would use as a role model for girls.  The boys are adorable. They feel like they need to protect Scarlet no matter what and she hates it. It shows how much they care about her. John is the big tough guy with a very small heart. Some people were annoyed by his presence in the romance but I never had any doubts about it. John is great but he is no match for the chemistry between Scarlet and Rob. You know they love each other but they still need to figure it out themselves. Cute but it never takes over. Rob is a wonderful leader. He feels his people and I always admire such characters. He does everything to keep his people save. There is also Much the boy with a low selfesteem after losing his hand. He teaches us that everyone can be a hero. Every secondary character plays an essential role  exactly how I like it.  The dynamic between these friends isnt the only thing I love. There is an interesting plot going on. The Hood is stealing to feed his people and the Sheriff is tired of him. He has hired a man everyone should fear the thief taker. This man would make me pie my pants. From his ruthless behavior to his cold looks I would be so scared. He is a perfect complex villain. And he played an important role in Scarlets past. A past that is catching up on her.. Figuring everything out was a lot of fun and Im extremely excited for Lady thief.;A.C. Gaughen

The first half of the book swooning and eating each others faces. I really started to get annoyed. I understand that you want to kiss all day hell I kiss all day if I get the chance  but you dont see me writing a book about it. I want action people I want a story with a proper story line. Just throw Jules in that would make it at least better. We do get a lot of time with Victoria and Arthur. They are new in the group and they are here to help them with the Numa problem. They are keeping low and its suspicious. They have a new leader but the Revenants have no idea who it is.  Well after that it becomes better. Luckily otherwise I dont think I could have finished it.

After a long search she finds an old book with a possible solution. Unfortunately the information is not complete and of course she does find a second copy with the rest. She visits the place but the owner is gone for some time. In the mean time they swoon a bit more. Kate gets the chance to talk to the owner and the old lady knows a way to help Vincent.  Thats when the action picks up. The old lady is kidnapped and the Numa finally attack. The leader stands up and the Numa take Vincent away. He is supposed to be the Champion and the leader wants to kill him to take over his power. Are they able to safe Vincent  Opinion.  The ending annoys me. Not only because its an open ending now I really want to find out what happens next.. Which means that I have to read the next book. It also surprised me I have to admit that. The ending was more exciting than the rest of the book (although thats not so hard). Im sorry for being so harsh I dont like to be mean so let me say a couple of things I did like  because in the end I read the whole book.  Kate is developing more. I liked that she searched for information behind Vincents back she is not planning to stay stupid. Vincent thinks he can keep Kate safe if he keeps her in the dark think twice pretty boy. I think Georgia is fantastic. She is everything Im not. Flirty and easy going with other people. Her humor is nice. If we would skip all the romance it could be a pretty good book.;Amy Plum

If you havent read Eve I would suggest to skip this review. There are spoilers.  Review  This story continues a few months after Eves arrival in Califia the safe haven for women. The King is still looking for her. She is hunted by her memories of Puck Arden Ruby and most of all Caleb. I was so happy when Arden returned in the story because I think she is more interesting than Eve.  When Arden and Eve overhear a conversation between the leaders of Califia its clear that they want to use Eve as a bargain. The two girls decide that its time to leave especially when they hear someone talk about Caleb. They leave in the night and walk right into a trap. They are caught and transported to the City. Arden is locked away in one of the camps Eve is taken to the King. I finally got the information I was waiting for. The reason why he is so desperate to find Eve and I liked the twist it gave to the story.  Caleb found a way to get into the City and he is trying to make tunnels under the City with some other rebels. Eve and Caleb have secret meetings and I thought they were so stupid. I understand that you want to be together. I know that youve missed each other but what the hell where they thinking It was just a matter of time before they are caught. I thought Caleb would be smarter than this because lets face it Eve is only intelligent when it comes to books. She isnt good at making good choices and she is too impulsive. I do love her loyalty towards Caleb. I cant wait to read Rise because the ending is a killer.  Conclusion  I liked this book more than Eve (rated with 3 flowers) Most of this book is about Eve worrying over Caleb (it seems like Arden isnt important enough) or trying to escape but I liked the background story. We get more information and we get to know more of the King.  You do anything for the person you love she said finally. And then when you dont think you can give any more of yourself you do. You keep going. Because it would kill you not to.;Anna Carey

It broke my heart. It tore my emotions apart. It touched me.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  How can I describe my love for this book in a rational way It will be hard for me since I havent read a book like this so far. It touched me in a way no other book did this year. How is it possible to tell Tiger Lilys heart breaking love story in words when you have to feel it Im going to try my best to tell you about this beautifully crafted story.  Summary.  Tiger Lily lives in the tribe Sky eaters. She is the adopted daughter of the leader Tik Tok who found her under the flower she is named after. One day there is a shipwreck and one boy survives but his penalty is death. Everybody is afraid to catch the aging disease. Tiger Lily is too stubborn and she saves the Englander. This will change her life. This is how she is going to meet the famous Peter Pan the boy everybody is scared of.  They kept apart from each other but it was as if a string attached their fingers because they could each feel each others hands even though they carefully kept their hands apart.  That is the best way to describe the love that is blossoming between them. Tiger Lily doesnt talk a lot and she always hide her feelings. But with Peter it is different. She smiles more she tries to come out of her shell and Peter is a better person around Tiger Lily too. The lost boys accept Tiger Lily like one of them. They always watch out for Captain Hook and his Pirates but Tiger Lily makes their life better. That is until a new ship arrives to pick up the Englander Tiger Lily saved. She is glad that he is going away because he takes over the village.  When something horrible happens in Tiger Lilys life she stays away from Peter for a while and thats when my heart broke. The Englander girl called Wendy steps into the story and she messes up everything. Peter and the Lost boys are leaving with her and Tiger Lily stays behind.  Opinion.  Damn you Wendy  This story is told from Tinks point of view. She cant talk but she is able to read minds and hearts. It was wonderfully picked because we get to meet Peter and Tiger Lily in a different way. Tiger Lily is fierce brave stubborn and restless. Peter is lost and loses his heart quickly but Tiger Lily always kept a piece of it. I wanted them to be together for ever even when I knew how the story would end. They were so sweet and they completed each other. They are both damaged and lonely. This story broke my heart crushed my feelings and made me want to cry. There was nothing I could do when I saw Tiger Lilys heart being shattered by Wendys appearance.  To make things even worse Peter wrote a letter to Tiger Lily and Ive never read anything so beautiful and pure. It was as if I was Tiger Lily and he wrote me that letter. You know that feeling when you really life inside the story and almost become one of the characters I felt all sad inside and you know that youve read a magnificent book if the author can give you those feelings. If this story doesnt touch you I dont know what else can. The letter was almost too much too handle for me. I know I have a weak soul when it comes to these broken love stories.  Im glad that this story doesnt end too unhappy. They both find their way to continue their lives. Tiger Lily is too strong to give up and she is happy but in another way. This story tears my emotions apart and I will read it again for sure. I cant look at Peter Pan the same way after reading this book.  The other characters in this book are great as well. We get to know them they play a role and arent there to fill up some space. I especially loved Tik Tok a man with a very present female side. He is a sweetheart. The worldbuilding is good the writing style is easy and almost poetic. The words flow.  Please do yourself a favor and get a copy from this book.;Jodi Lynn Anderson

She takes advantage of that by following that person and stealing all hisher money. She seems to be unable to change the course of dead when she tried a little boy died because of her. That is still hunting her in her nightmares so she wont interfere with the path of life.  This book starts with one of her victims. She robbed him and she got a ride from Louis to a bar. Thats how she meets Ashley. Yes its a boy and he has that bad boy attitude. She is turned on by it so they have sex and they hang out. He finds her journey and he wants to work together. They are searching for the perfect victim and that is how Louis comes in the picture. She saw that he will die within a couple of days. Ashley has made the plan that Louis will be there next victim but there is something about him that touched Miriam.

He stole a suitcase full of drugs and the owner wants it back no matter what. Soon the pieces of the puzzle fall together and Miriam must do everything in her power if she wants to save Louis.  The story is told from Miriams point of view. There is a lot of violence and cursing. She loves alcohol and cigarettes.  My mother always said I had a mouth like a sailor. Not in an arr matey way but in a fuck this and shit that way. And yes I am a big fat liar. My dirty tornup jeans on fire.  And thats exactly how Miriam is throughout the whole book. She is foul mouthed sharp and she has a very strange I dont give a damn attitude. For me the whole concept of stealing someones money after watching that person die is so strange. Id never do something like that and I certainly cant understand why she is doing it. Why isnt she able to get a job  There are some Interludes in this book and some of them provide more information about Miriam. Like telling about her past her mother was very religious and had strict rules. Those rules are returning in Miriams dreams also described in those chapters. Some of them are pretty scary with Louis ghost talking to her and blaming her for his dead.  Im not quite sure about this book. I liked the concept of touching someone and seeing how they die but Miriam wasnt a very likeable character. What I do know is that I love the cover You have to find out for yourself if this book works for you. Im still not sure if Im going to read the next one. Thats the reason why I cant rate this one.;Chuck Wendig

No longer stuck in Cats shadow Kittys now caught between two menthe object of her affection and the object of her desire. But court is also full of secrets lies and sordid affairs and as Kitty witnesses Cats meteoric rise and fall as queen she must figure out how to keep being a good friend when the price of telling the truth could literally be her head.;398;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1364266703m12952710.jpg;Gilt;history historical fiction biography;Hmmm I really liked the writingstyle but Kitty annoyed me and I also didnt like Cat.  Edit also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  I consider myself a big fan of the Tudors era. Most of the historical fiction I read are about the queens and the court of Henry VIII. Last year Ive read my first book about Catherine Howard Alisa Libby  The kings rose. I was surprised by the voice of Cat but this book is completely the opposite. The Cat we see here is the same as the queen we see in the television show. This made it hard for me to rate this book. While I was intrigued by her and Kittys story I had a hard time to connect to the characters. The writingstyle was definitely pleasant and the atmosphere for the treacherous court was nicely done. That is why I settled down to a rating of 3.  This story is told from the POV of Kitty Tylney best friend of Catherine Howard. They live a boring and quiet life in Cats grandmothers house. Except for the secret nights were Cat and Francis are having fun not knowing that this will become Cats downfall.  Cat always dreamt of living at court dancing flirting and gossiping. Kitty is her shadow and she follows Cat everywhere. That was one of the annoying things and I had a hard time to overlook this aspect of Kittys personality. She has no spine. She is obedient and blind when it comes to her friendship with the egoistic Cat and that results in many stupid decisions.  When the King marries his new queen  Anne of Cleves  he is looking for new maidens. Cat is one of the lucky girls and she is soon swept away in her new life. Kitty stays behind and as a true whiner she feels rejected and jealous. But Cat is climbing on her social ladder and she caught the Kings eyes. Soon she is married with him and she brings Kitty to court.  From here on we encounter many facepalm situations. Or even better  I can understand that Cat is still a young naive girl and its very clear that she isnt ready for such an important task but the thing she does.. She should have known better and Kitty is just as stupid. Instead of seeing the truth (that Cat is a horrible friend who only uses her to feel better) she keeps bowing for Cats fits. I wished that she would have grown throughout the book but her character development is nonexistent.  Despite my annoyance for most of the characters I was hooked to the good writingstyle. Longshore has a descriptive flowy way of writing and it was fun to see the treachery among the court members. Im definitely excited enough to read part 2 which will be about my favorite Queen from this era Anne Boleyn.;Katherine Longshore

The take on werewolves added something new to the genre.The characters were alright and the mystery around Amys dead was enjoyable. I wasnt completely blown away by the story though.  This book is filled with a lot of surprising twists something I really liked. The story is pretty simple. Mackenzie Amy Jason and Kyle were best friends until Amy is murdered by a werewolf. Their group is starting to fall apart. Jason was Amys boyfriend and he is trying to join the Trackers. They are a nongovernmental group against werewolves. Mac decides to search for the werewolf herself to keep Jason away from them but she gets threatened by the leader of the group. Thats when Kyle comes to the rescue but he makes things only worse.  Mac was a solid character. She is loyal to her friends and she had some brave moments. Her background story is sad but she never whines about it. I didnt know what to think of Jason but I liked Kyle. Amy was terrifying because she appears in Macs nightmares. This girl had a lot of secrets. There are some other interesting characters like Macs niece Tess and her friend Ben.  This book didnt blow me away as much as I expected. There was a bit too much teen angst for my taste and the KyleMac situation started to get annoying. I wanted more action and investigation instead of love drama. Halfway there is something that looks like a lovetriangle and I didnt like it. But like I mentioned before there were some great twists. I always like it when an author can surprise me by going into a different direction. The plot was good. I liked how Mac slowly unraveled the secrets around Amys death and the ending of this book makes me excited for part two. The only thing Im worried about is that it might be a book filled with even more drama since the mystery is solved.  Are you alright he asked warily. Sure I lied as I turned and headed for the stairs. So softly that only a werewolf could hear I added You cant lose what you never had.;Kathleen Peacock

The plot was good. But some parts were a bit boring and Christian annoyed me a lot. Review coming soon )  2.5 stars also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  I suggest to skip this review if you havent read Boundless because there are spoilers. To give you a short version of the review it was boring.  You can say that I am very disappointed with this book. Im not sure what happened but the story went from interesting in the first two books to incredibly boring.  Let me start by saying three positive things about this book. Samjeeza is still there. From every character in the book he is the most fascinating. I also liked the twist with Angelas pregnancy and how that added some excitement to the thin plot. Did anybody suspected this when Angela was acting so strange I did come to the realization that I actually dont like her that much. She is bossy mean and a hypocrite. I was also happy to see some more of Jeffrey but I still feel like he didnt get enough time to shine. He was always there on the background and I think there was more to him.  The thing that bothered me the most is the fact that Christian is there. All. the. freaking. time. You can say that I wasnt a big fan of him but I went to a straight hater.  Are you kidding me I cant even.. He expects her to give up her feelings just like that Oh boy can you imagine that a girl doesnt like you The horror It must be impossible to understand annoying bonehead. One thing I admired about him is the fact that he stays such a good and loyal friend because Clara doesnt deserve that.  This is going to start my rant about Clara. She really need to make up her mind and stop acting like a whiny baby She keeps popping up at Tuckers place giving him all these double signals and she is dating with Christian while she is thinking of Tucker. Come on do I have to spell it out for you Stop wasting your time and go to your boy already. At least she ends up with Tucker otherwise I would have dropped the rating to 2 flowers. On the other hand how the hell did she end with such a sweet nice guy when she is screwing with his feelings  The plot was like I said very thin. This book was definitely not like the other two. It is completely based on the romance and the lovetriangle instead of the battle. When we were heading towards the ending I was hoping on a good fight. Unfortunately its fairly easy solved.  Let me say it this way if I knew that the series ended like this I might never started it in the first place.;Cynthia Hand

My first experience with Zoe Marriott was her lovely retelling The swan kingdom. From that moment I knew I had to read more from her and the sweet Kristen gave this copy to me. Thanks to her Im now aware that I really like Marriotts stories and Im going to hunt down a copy from the companion novel called Frostfire. You can download the first chapter for free if you like to try it out Zoe Marriott.  The worldbuilding and concept of this book are pretty basic. Ruan is attacked by Sedorne and the Royal family is butchered The Sedorne king is a tyrant and destroys everything but he forgot that one person survived. Zira is rescued by her maid and taken to the covenant where Surya becomes her second mother. She is trained as a warrior and when she finds out who she truly is Ziras life changes forever. Together with the Sedornse lord Sorin Zira is ready to free her people.  The thing that makes this story different is Zira. I loved this girl. She has fire and a passion in her that makes her indestructible. This could easily led to an Imfartooperfectcharacter but Zira has enough flaws to make her realistic. She has a soft side and finding out who she truly is makes her insecure. She questions herself a lot despite her warrior training. We get a girl whose life completely changed and we see how she adapts and grows through all her trials. She is capable of clever decisions even when she is frightened she is even willing to sacrifice others instead of throwing herself in a dangerous situation where she could be killed. It was so refreshing  The romance might have been a little too fast but Marriott manages to stay clear from the instalove. I could see how the decision was necessary at that time even when both of the characters were a little naive and too hopeful. Nevertheless I really liked Sorin and how they both grew toward each other. What started as a strategic connection turns out into a loyal respectful and balanced relationship.  I was surprised by the villain and his background story. Its not like anything Ive read in a while and I love how Marriot twisted him into someone you almost feel sorry for. I dont agree with his life choices but it seems he is a trouble person who makes very bad choices instead of being a bad person. The ending is like I expected from this book. Everything is solved easily and is neatly wrappedup. Just the way I like my endings most of the times. Definitely check it out;Zoe Marriott

Im not sure what happened after that moment because I never got a copy until now. Thanks to Reviews from a bookworm I was introduced to the amazing and terrifying world of Not a drop to drink.  Lynn and her mother manage to survive because of their pond. Its a daily struggle to purify the water and to get enough food especially with the winter coming. Lately there has been another treat humans. Everyone would kill for a spot like that but Lynn and her mother are ready for them  until Lynn is alone.  There isnt much worldbuilding because we only have the information Lynn and her mother have but that wasnt such a problem. We know that there is a shortage of water that people are dying because they drink contaminated water and you always need to be careful because people will steal your stuff and safe place if they get the chance. This is what I admire about the story the constant treat which makes the book very intense. There is the chance things will fall apart and you are always aware of the danger lurking around them.  Lynn is an interesting character. All her traits could easily make her a very unlikable character but there was something about her that made me like her anyway. If she would read this I think she would curse me shouting she doesnt need me to like her. She couldnt care less about the opinion of others its all about survival. She is cold egoistic and practical but I guess thats because of her upbringing. Her mother always taught here she cant trust anybody  and she should shoot first and think later. When Lynn is left alone we get to see how she develops and changes. She even accepts a little girl in her household called Lucy and she manages to develop feelings for a boy. We see that behind her strong and hard face there is more.  Lucy is adorable and admirable. She has been through a lot but never falls into whining too much. Lynn wouldnt let her anyway but despite their forced relationship Lynn makes place for Lucy in a tiny soft spot in her heart. I liked their connection and how fiercely protective Lynn can be. The girl thrives under the care. I also liked Sebb the lame neighbour across the field and Eli who tried to take care of Lucy before she came into Lynns life.  If you like romance and think its essential this isnt the book for you. Mindy hardly touches the subject and she isnt afraid to devastate you with a couple of turns in her storyline. But if you look for a very good apocalyptic book that feels realistic this is the one for you. I also thought it had a very solid ending but I can already tell you that the companion novel (that felt more like a sequel to me) lives up to the expectations and was just as good as this one. Keep an eye on the blog for the review of In a handful of dust.;Mindy McGinnis

But what does he want from herFeaturing haunting archival earlytwentiethcentury photographs this is a tense romantic story set in a past that is eerily like our own time.;387;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1348721608m13112915.jpg;In the Shadow of Blackbirds;history historical fiction biography;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  When I began this book I had high expectations. I love everything that has to do with diseases  even if its just a small element and the author knows what she is talking about. It was such a wellwritten story with an amazing protagonist and a scary mystery.  Mary Shelly fled from her home when they took her father as prisoner. On her way its obvious that the country is in desperation. The Spanish influenza claims lives every day and there is a constant fear of losing loved ones on the battlefield. People do anything in their desperation seances and spirit photographers are more than happy to provide them with comfort for a good price. Mary doesnt believe in all that nonsense until Julian (Stephens brother) takes her picture and Stephens ghost appears on the background. Stephen is her childhood lover and he signed up to go to war. His ghost haunts her now and its up to her to help him find peace. She must find out what happened to him.  This story was spooky and the addition of real photographs created an extra creepy atmosphere. I loved it The photographs made it even easier to connect with the story. Its not difficult to understand why people gave so much money for a picture with their deceased loved ones. I liked how scientific Mary was and how she didnt believe in those spirit photographers until she gets visitations from Stephens ghost. He has no rest and keeps telling her that the blackbirds are killing him. He came to the right place because Mary is a very intelligent determined young girl. Shes not afraid and despite her sadness she is capable of clever decisions. I dont think I could be as tough as she was because his ghost terrified me.  The mystery was fantastic and I was surprised by the conclusion. I had my suspicions but she blew me away with the climax. Its also obvious that Cat Winters did her research on this subject. The Spanish Flu and all the ways people tried to prevent an infection were nicely incorporated. I could feel everyones fear especially from Marys aunt. I wish there were more books with such accurate portrayal of an infection disease.  The only thing that let me down was the romance. Stephen and Mary had a fling in the past but there are only some short moments in the form of flashbacks. I didnt get enough time to see their love which gave his death less impact. I wish I felt more sadness in the beginning. It was better towards the ending when the story is wrapped up. Im going to keep an eye on her next book for sure.;Cat Winters

I loved the time in the Everneath and the ending Cole..  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  The thing is if I love the first book Im excited and scared for the second one at the same time. Most of them suffer from the secondbookislamesyndrome and it always spoils the excitement I felt after the first one. That is not the case with Everbound and that is prove for me that Ashton knows how to write a good interesting story. You can read the summary if you havent read Everneath yet. My summary gives about the same information as the blurb.Nikki is plagued by guilt after Jacks sacrifice. He appears in her dreams every night and that is the only evidence that he is still alive. Nikki is desperate and when Jack is starting to fade away its time to act. The only problem is Cole who is still in love with Nikki. He doesnt want to save Jack and he believes its a waste of time but after a lot of discussions and complaining he takes her to the Everneath. The road to the tunnels is long and filled with obstacles. Nikki is willing to do everything so save Jack but is she strong enough to conquer the mazeI must admit that I had a bit of a struggle at the start (thats the reason why this book is rated with 45 instead of 55 like Everneath). Nikki was a bit too whiny for my taste but that changed quickly after her decision to save Jack. She is willing to do everything so instead of complaining she acts. I admire her for her strength and how she stood up against Cole. Its always a relief when the MC doesnt need anyone to save her. Nikki is quite capable of doing things on her own and she is intelligent enough to make clever choices. And when she does make a mistake (because shes not perfect at all) they are understandable. And Cole.. I do like him but damn he manages to give me mood swings. When I finally start to think he is good he pulls another trick. The complexity and unpredictability of his character are great and he completes the story. Jack is just a sweetheart but he doesnt get much time to shine in this story.The worldbuilding was interesting. I liked the background story about the Everneath and the different trials Nikki needs to survive in order to save Jack. The queen definitely likes her privacy because those rings around her house (in the centre) are hard I knew the queens identity for a while but I still like the story Ashton created here.The twist at the ending was awesome. I didnt see it coming and I was surprised how cunning Cole really is. His way to trap Nikki was crafty and I must say well played boy I really liked the somewhat closed ending but it still makes me very curious and excited for Evertrue;Brodi Ashton

I liked Partials a lot especially the medical background of the RM virus. This book was just.. nothing like that. There are spoilers in the summary part if you havent read Partials but you can read the spoilerfree review where I talk about my likes and dislikes.  Summary.  The story is told from two different angles. First we have Kira. She is looking for answers after she found out that she is a special Partials. She meets Afa on her quest. He used to work for ParaGen but years of being alone has taken his toll. Afa is confused and highly unstable but Kira needs him. Together with Samm and Heron Kira embarks on a dangerous journey to find answers to save both races.  The other part is about Marcus her some sort of boyfriend. When the Partials attack he manages to escape. The Partials are hunting down Kira because their doctor wants to examine her for answers to their expiration date. Marcus is trying to find a way to stop the Partials and that is when he finds out about the huge secret around Kira and her sisters.  Review.  I still cant believe I managed to finish this book because I hard a hard time. The story starts good and I liked the two different POVs. I never felt anything for Marcus but his side of the story was interesting. We get to see the chaos after the Partials attack and the sick determination of doctor Morgan to find an answer to their expiration date.  Putting the pieces of the puzzle together with him and Kira was fun. We finally get answers about Kira and the background about the Partials was welldone. There were still too many things that bugged me. I still cant understand how one man can come up with things like energy while a complete city isnt able to fix it. This was difficult to understand and it left a hole in the plot for me.  Kira is throwing herself Afa and two Partials in extremely dangerous situations because she is determined to find answers. People are killed because of her and I found her irresponsible hypocritical ignorant and annoying. She is whiny and so different from the first book where I admired her strength and intelligence. Heron was the only character I liked because she isnt afraid to say things out loud and I loved her confidence.  Theyre there Kira said again.  But what if theyre not  Then we keep going Kira shouted. Because theyre out there somewhere I know it.  You dont know anything Its just what your desperate messedup psyche wants to believe. (Heron)  The pacing was perhaps the most troublesome aspect. It. was. slow. I could have skipped the middle part of this book without any problems. Nothing really happens and I was bored I will read Ruins because the overall concept and writingstyle are good.;Dan Wells

I need to include some gifs to show you my love for this book because I cant express it with words alone. This was just epic and perfect. I might even liked it more than Cinder because we get to meet Scarlet Wolf and Thorne. More of that later in the summary first  All right. Im okay. Im okay. Breathe  If you havent read Cinder there are spoilers in the summary but you can read the review conclusion and quote )  Summary  This book starts with Scarlet. She is worried about her grandmother who disappeared two weeks ago. The authority has given up their search but Scarlet is determined to find her. There is something wrong she knows is. During one of her working days she meets Wolf. He has something to do with her grandmother and he confesses that he was part of a special Pack. Now he is offering his help to find her back and Scarlet knows that she needs him.  Every other chapter we get to see the story of our beloved Cinder. She is trying to escape out of the prison (remember Cinder warned Kai that Queen Levana wants to marry him so she can kill him to take control over the world. Cinder is actually Princess Selene from Lunar and she is a treat to Levanas hold of the throne. That is why Levana wants her dead.) Cinder literally falls into the cell of Captain Thorne. He is there for several criminal actions and one of them is stealing a space ship. They flee together and Cinder gets information about Michelle Benoit Scarlets grandmother.  That is how their stories come together on a critical point near the end of the book.  Review  Im going to try to explain why I loved this book so much. First it was fun to switch between the stories of ScarletWolf and CinderThorne. I adore every character. They are so fleshed out and its great how kick ass Scarlet and Cinder are. They arent helpless or weak but smart and caring. Scarlet is so loyal. She is willing to do anything to save her grandmother. Wolf is dangerous sexy and Thorne is a sweet womanizer. We also have glimpses of Kai who is trying to make the best decisions for his country. Queen Levana is a true villain and we finally get to see why she is such a danger her evil master plan is revealed.  Second I liked the way she showed parts of the first book. Instead of explaining the first book like a summary we get subtle reminders of what happened to keep the story clear and easy to follow.  I was constantly turning pages and I was sucked into their stories. Her writing style is so addictive and flowing. It was fun to see how Cinder and Scarlet meet and what their connection is. This climax was so welldone. It was somewhat predictable but Marissa shows that its not always a bad thing. As long as you fill the book with action romance and awesome characters you can work with a strong predictable plot. The ending was heartbreaking. Not because its a cliffhanger (thank god) but I realized that I have to wait a year before I can continue this series. It was satisfying though. I cant stand most cliffhangers and this was a good wrapped up ending.  Im going to count the days until I can have Cress in my hands.  Conclusion  Awesome. Perfection.

It was fantastic and I read more than 500 pages in one sitting but the ending still left me with a little disappointed feeling of I want more. It feels like there was still some story left to tell. Perhaps in the novella bindup with the Epilogue to Winter I HOPE SO. The main story is wrapped up neatly so perhaps its because Im just not ready to let go of all the characters I fell in love with throughout the series. I could read about them forever and Im satisfied with all the ships and the overall conclusion of the story. My only problem was the fact I didnt like how villainous Levana was and how I couldnt care about her reasons for all the things she did.;Marissa Meyer

Im sorry. Gave up on page 70. I had to force myself to read it and thats now how I work. I will give you an explanation for my DNF  I requested this book because I was fascinated by the Amish. Instead of that I get a story that goes on and on about their attraction towards each other. The chapters switch between Noah (pretty name by the way) and Rose but the only thing I got so far is how they describe each other. I got a little sight of how the Amish live (and I very honest really dislike there way of living. Dont want to insult anybody but I dont like living styles with traditional roles) but I want more Instead of that he tells constantly how fascinating Rose is. He wants to stay away but he wants to be with her but he really cant but he want to blablabla. Its a bit like Twilight without all the sparkle.  Rose constantly thinks in ways as he needs to change his behavior if we are together. You only know him for one freaking day.  In honesty couldnt care less if they come together or not and I dont think thats the way you need to feel p  So.. Its just not meant to be I guess. Perhaps this book works out for you because I see a lot of positive reviews about this book. And I definitely wanted to love this one but I dont )  Edit  You know what is the worst thing After seeing all these horrible things on the web about authorspublishershusbands attacking reviewers Im almost scared to put this on Goodreads.. It seems like you cant have a negative opinion anymore because they will jump right on top of it and tear it to the ground. What is going on I simply feel sad for the world we are living in right now.. There is NOTHING wrong with disliking a book. Its the same thing you come across everyday. There are certain clothes you dont like artwork you dont want in your house cars you dont want to drive in etc. So what the hell is wrong with disliking a book and telling others about it s Ugh.;Karen Ann Hopkins

I read it in one day because I couldnt stop. I made friends with Tris and Four. It was fastpaced filled with action and some romance. This book had everything you could ask for. Thats why its so hard to write a decent review about it but Im going to try.  It must be because youre so approachable I say flatly. You know. Like a bed of nails.  Beatrice Prior lives in a divided society. There are five factions each based on a virtue and they have their own responsibility. You have Candor (honest) Abnegation (selfless) Dauntless (brave) Amity (peaceful) and Erudite (intelligent). Years ago people realized that its not political ideology religious believe race or nationalism that is to blame for a warring world. They determined that it was the fault of human personality so they divided the world into factions that sought to eradicate those qualities they believe responsible for the worlds disarray. On an appointed day of every year all sixteenyearolds must select a faction they will stay for the rest of their lives. You can understand that its a hard choice.  Beatrice her brother and her parents live in Abnegation and she doesnt feel like she belongs there. Its her turn to choose a faction. During the test she is inclonclusive and that makes her a Divergent. (Which means that her test doesnt point to one faction but more). Nobody must find out because its dangerous. At the Choosing Ceremony Beatrice chooses for Dauntless. She must pass different tests before she is allowed in the faction. Thats how she meets Four an intruiging boy who is their instructor. But soon he is becoming more for her.  When Tris finds out that Erudite and Dauntless are planning a war she wants to know more about it. How will they persuade the Dauntless to fight against Abnegation But the people from Erudite have everything covered and its up to Tris and Four to safe her old faction and to stop a war. Will they succeed  Let me tell you this the ending is filled with action. The book build towards it and it certainly delivers. I couldnt put it down.  Opinion.  Im not going to make a list about the things I liked and disliked because there is nothing I didnt like about this book. It has everything in it. From a sweet developing love to a lot of action and dead people. Roth certainly doesnt spare our heroin. Tris is a tough brave girl. She is far from perfect she is selfish and she makes some stupid mistakes but thats what I liked about her. It makes her real. She makes some amazing friends and of course the mysterious Four. From the moment they met there was a certainly chemistry between him and Tris. He is a great character.  The storyline is wonderful. The worldbuilding we get is great. You get the history of the factions and I find it fascinating. From the beginning you understood that something was going to happen. A society based on factions is doomed to fail. This tension combined with the action we get in Dauntless makes sure that the book never gets boring. This book really lives up to the high expectations I had.  There is so much more I want to tell you There are so many things going on like the different tests Tris must pass in order to become a Dauntless member and the secrets in her family. So really if you havent read this one buy it and devour it. Its so good.;Veronica Roth

Because after that night Jake will never be able to talk again. When Jake returns to his small island home population 5000 hell have to learn how to deal with being mute. He also finds that his family isnt limited to his six brothers and sisters that sometimes an entire island is watching out for you. And when he gets the chance to spend more time with Samantha shell help him learn that not being able to talk isnt the worst thing that could ever happen to you. Maybe if shell let him Jake will finally tell her what he didnt say before even if he cant actually say it.;336;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1355090370m13366929.jpg;What I Didnt Say;youngadult;Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com...  She was smarter than all of us. And it only made me want her more.  Jake is in love with Sam. They used to be friends but now they dont have so much contact. When he and his friends are drunk at a party he decides its a clever thing to go to her and tell her that he loves her. Being drunk and driving a car doesnt work that well. They crash and Jake loses the ability to speak. Its hard to get used to the fact that never get another chance to tell Sam that he loves her but the accident did bring them closer to each other. Jake is taking sign language in an attempt to move on and Sam becomes his teacher. They communicate a lot via his notebooks and they develop into having some sort of relationship. Sam is a bit scared of calling it a relationship. She doesnt believe in love.  Jakes has a wonderful big family. His mother is a second mother to everyone on their little island. She is caring and he gets a lot of support from her his father and his brothers and sisters. I especially liked Jordan his sister who is a big help to him and James his little brother.  You look like a mime or something when you do that James said his tone totally serious. Your body tries to laugh but nothing comes out.  These situations makes the story lighter and shows us that losing something in our lives doesnt have to mean that our lives stop. We can move on. Things can change and yes you can feel sorry for yourself but their must come a moment you just stop whining. Thats something he learns when Sam is yelling at him.  Your friends might not get it she made little quote marks in the air. But theyre still trying to be there for you. And all you can do is shut out the world and feel sorry for yourself.  Thats when Jake finds out what Sam has been hiding. The reason why she is tired all the time and why she is becoming so skinny. She has been living on her own for a while now. With the little money she has and the few stuff she gathered she is living in a small boathouse in the woods. Thats when her father shows up to get her and their world start falling apart. It means that Sam has to move. How will that change their future  I really liked this story about standing up and moving on after losing something precious. It seems horrible to lose your voice and become mute in one silly moment or losing someone you love. Jake is a sweet boy. He takes care of Sam when she needs him the most and he can cope with her strange moods. His whiny behavior is understandable but I was glad that Sam told him the truth. Sometimes he had too much selfpity. Sam was a delightful character. Strong smart and brave. I like her input in this story but I wished several times that we got to know more about Jake. After all its his story. I wanted this story to be based on his accident instead on his insecurity about Sam. Overall a nice story which makes you think about life and moving on.;Keary Taylor

The first time I read Daughter of smoke and bone I gave it 3.5 flowers. I had trouble with the beginning of the book and I wasnt blown away. When I bought the sequels I decided to reread the book and I was surprised I liked it so much more I was sucked into the story right away. For some reason the story worked better the second time so I ended up giving it 4 flowers now.  The sequels continued to stun me. Laini has a way with words and its easy to get lost inside her tale. She spins a story in front of you and before you know it you are hooked inside it. The story grows dark in Days of blood and starlight and continues to be more gruesome in Dreams of Gods and Monsters. I absolutely loved it and I like how she managed to make the books enjoyable instead of being too dark or depressing. Her worldbuilding is excellent. Laini found the perfect balance there is enough details to make it vivid but not so much that there are infodumps.  Daughter of smoke and bone could be seen as a very good setup because thats when we learn about Karous background. It was interesting to find out what was going on and who she really is. Her friendship with Zuzana was adorable and its good to see that the girl plays a constant important role in her life. She isnt swept away when the plot kicks in. Laini managed to write her into the story in a subtle way making sure she is there when Karou needs her the most.  The romance between Akiva and Karou had a touch of instalove but its quite understandable when you know the whole story. However it wasnt my favorite aspect of the story. I loved Karou and her feisty intelligent personality. I wasnt a huge fan of Akiva for some reason. He always felt a little flat to me and I didnt feel connected to him. I did warm up to him in the sequel  my favorite part of the series. Days of blood and starlight was amazing and I had to give it 5 flowers. Karou takes an important role in the upcoming war between the two different camps. We get to see glimpses of Karous past and are introduced to new characters like the White Wolf Ziri and the nasty Jael. Ziri was adorable and stole my heart right away. Jael was creepy and provides an interesting bad guy.  The war breaks loose in Dreams of Gods and monsters. Its a battle with many consequences and its fascinating to see how old enemies unite against a common enemy. There is also a new problem coming up someone is hunting down Akiva. All these threats make the story intense and fastpaced. I was constantly turning pages wanting more. The other two books ended with crazy cliffhangers but this book has a spectacular perfect ending. I couldnt have wished for more.  Laini has found her way to my list of favorite authors and I look forward to her new books.;Laini Taylor

I enjoyed this book but its a bad sign that I seem to forget about many details already.. That doesnt happen a lot to me and I have to say this book didnt impress me so much as Legend. I loved the worldbuilding though. It was interesting to finally find out how this all started and in this aspect it outshines Legend. The character development and the overall plot were less engaging for me but its not a bad sequel at all.  The biggest problem I had was one of my favorite aspects in the first book. I wasnt such a fan of June and Day now. They both lost some of their charm from the beginning. I missed the chemistry between them and I didnt like their interactions. I was happy that June stayed true to herself but Days easy mistrust was annoying.  The pacing is okay but the middle part was a bit boring. Nothing seems to happen and I expected more excitement. The fact that June is about to help in a plot to murder the new Elector promises me much action but it was hardly there. Its more about Junes doubt and Days struggle to believe in her. It was also more about the lies from the rebels. This book was more about the psychological aspect instead of fighting and that wasnt what I expected.  I liked the ending though. This book could easily be the ending of this series. I always like it when books in a series almost work as standalones. Despite my disappointing Im looking forward to Champion.;Marie Lu

Every chapter starts with a lovely drawing and some titles are really fun like The lumerlumpen.  Liza is a clever and brave girl. She stands up for what she believes because her parents always tell her to stop making up all those stories.

They sip dreams from The River of Knowledge and they deliver them to their own human.  I also like the surroundings Liza encounters on her way to the Spindlers nest. There is a lot of danger in the Below and there is not a moment of rest. Liza always has to run or fight for her life together with guide Mirabella. The three difficult rooms reminded me a bit of Harry Potter and they are wonderfully done.  Dislikes.  Sometimes the lines are really really long. Just look at the quote.

This book shines when it comes to characters. We have a colorful cast and I appreciate how interesting the secondary characters are. I have a feeling everyone is playing a role and they arent just there. I think that my favourite secondary character is Persephone. She has a whimsical innocent and almost fairytalelike personality.  The Raven Boys are a fascinating group of boys consisting of Gansey (the leader) Adam Ronan and Noah. Blue is later added to that mix because her special gift might come in handy and she has caught Adams attention. These two are incredibly sweet together and Adam was probably the raven boy I felt most connection with. Not because Ive been in the same situation but his actions emotions and reactions felt very realistic to me. I have a soft spot for him. Gansey grew on me but I dont feel I know him well enough. I hope he shows more of his personality in The dream thieves.  Blue heard the same over and over again. You are going to kill your true love with a kiss. When she finally sees a ghost it belongs to Gansey  and this means he will die soon. Their fates are connected and its one of the reasons she offers her help to him. Gansey is obsessed with finding the ley line because once activated he can find Glendower. There is a story that Glendower was buried but he can be awakened and he will bestow you with a gift.  But The Raven Boys arent the only one looking for the ley line and its starting to get dangerous. You already know who the villain is but it didnt make him less creepy. This is a person who is willing to sacrifice anyone and anything to get what he wants. The plot around the ley line and Glendower was good. I liked how we slowly figure out why Gansey needs to find it and the ending makes me very excited to see what is going to happen in The dream thieves.;Maggie Stiefvater

Above all it is a story about the power of stories our belief in them and how one enchanted tale changed the course of an entire kingdom.;424;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1376150332m13455485.jpg;Iron Hearted Violet;fantasy paranormal;Gorgeous book It is filled with artwork that really added something to the story. Violet is smart witty and loved by her people but she is described as downright ugly. This is starting to become a problem when she wakes the Nybbass who fills her head with lies. He makes her believe that true princesses are beautiful and he can help her with that problem. I liked the friendship between Violet and Demetrius. I also loved the presence of the dragon and the message in this book.;Kelly Barnhill Iacopo Bruno

And let me say you this that feeling is fantastic It felt like I was back in one of my favorite series ever.  Summary.  Once upon a time there was a city called Bath. That was until strange things started to happen. The faeries slipped into the world and the Smiling wars began until humans converged on the fay and scattered them. The ages of Smoke started in New Bath and the fay adapted to their new lives waiting for a new change to change the world.  Dont get yourself noticed and you wont get yourself hanged.  That is the rule ever Peculiar must follow if heshe wants to stay alive. They are changelings or Halflings. They dont belong to the faeries nor to the humans so they must survive under poor conditions. Bartholomew is one of them together with his sister Hettie. When a lady in plum appears in their neighbourhood thinks are about to change. She takes one of his friends with her and he will be one of the many dead Peculiars. Nobody gives the strange murder any attention  they are scum after all  until Mr. Jelliby decides to investigate the matter. He suspects that one of the most important man has something to do with it.  When Hettie disappears Bartholomew and Mr. Jellibys lives become entwined. Bartie will do anything to save his little sister from a horrible fate and Mr. Jelliby is the only one who can stop the destruction of their world.  Opinion.  Im very glad with the ending of this story because there will be another book The story isnt over yet and I think we are up to a lot of action. Its unbelievable that this author is so young because his writing style is amazing almost poetic.  Mr. Jelliby grew on me. He felt a bit arrogant in the beginning but he is the only one who seem to care about the Peculiars. He puts himself in a lot of danger to safe the world and Hettie. He makes smart choices and the enemy isnt happy with him.  Bartie is a sweetheart. He will do anything to save his little sister. He even wants to sacrifice his own life. He is very young but it never bothered me.  The enemy is well done. Its a cruel and unkind person. The world will be plunged into darkness to gain more power and Peculiars are used for his own sake. I liked that one of his helpers reminded me of Voldemort in the first book from Harry Potter.  I absolutely cant wait for part 2. There is something comforting about his style like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket. His words read so easy you hardly have the feeling you are reading at all. Its like everything is playing in your head like a movie do you know that feeling  If you like Harry Potter and Neil Gaiman this is something for you. There is darkness action and some spooky magic but there is also hope love and friendship.;Stefan Bachmann

Review coming soon.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  But whos the say whats perfect  Im not sure how and why I finished this book. It gave me many feelings but not the right ones. Instead of feeling connected to the characters and excited about the scifi elements I was frustrated annoyed and I couldnt care less what would happen to any of them. There was a twist I liked and it was a quick book but thats all. Ill be using many quotes to illustrate the dumb and irritating characters so be aware of my rant. I hardly rate books with 1 flowers but this..  Everyone should have flaws. Isnt that what makes us interesting Isnt that what keeps us from just being carbon copies of each other  The beginning was not bad. We are introduced to Evening (who goes by E.V among friends) who is horrible injured after a car crash. Her mother transports her to her own research facility. Eves mother is a billionaire with her groundbreaking research and Eve is interested in genetics. Her mother gives her the task to create her perfect boy with a new software program. Solo lives in the facility after his parents both died in a car accident. He hates Eves mother and he is planning to bring her down with horrible information but things are not always what they seem.  The chapters are divided between Eve and Solo and I didnt care for either of them. Eve is as dumb as a doornail. I guess her mothers genes went to her appearance because boy I wanted to head desk many times. There were also situations where she is blind. I was mentally screaming the answer because it was so obvious.. Its not strange to her that her leg is almost healed in four days. It was severed from her body THATS NOT NORMAL. She is also very shallow  How can I date a guy named Tad Its a ridiculous name.  Imagine that Not only that I started to see what a horrible friend she really is. Yes she offers Aislin help in the beginning but quotes like these  Why do I love Aislin Because with her whole life falling apart she thinks about me. She still cares about me.  makes me doubt her intentions. For her thats what life and friendship is all about. You have to be the center of attention no matter what. Its not important that Aislins boyfriend just got shot or that the doctor tells her he probably wont survive. No its important that Aislin asks if you already banged with Solo.  Solo is also a perfect example of stupidity. Imagine this Eves leg just got stitched together and Solo is in the ambulance to bring her to the facility. Her accident happened a couple of hours ago she is in pain and under medication.  I sit with my elbows on my knees trying to hunch my shoulder forward a little. I have good shoulders might as well reveal them. I know shes checking me out. Fair enough because Im checking her out.  REALLY But after she starts to moan and cry he imagines that he might be wrong.  This brings me to the nosurprise instalove. Solo and Eve hardly see each other they dont talk that much and they still fall in love. And its disgusting I mean  And theres possible drool in the left corner of her mouth. Why do I find that kind of hot Seriously. Sleep drool.  Uhm YUCK I guess we are not on the same page when it comes to hot. But I dont think this is surprising after this distasteful scene  Tommy grins at me. He reaches out one finger and swipes the blood from my forehead. He sticks the finger in his mouth and licks it.  We are talking about a genius scientist here. Im not sure what kind of creepy image these authors have of scientist but this is just sick.  I loathed Eves mother. Being smart doesnt have to make you cold and bitter. She likes to stick her nose in the air and I couldnt tolerate her arrogance. She is especially good at criticizing everyone below her standards like Eves friend Aislin.  Pfff. Friends plural My mother asks. Since when do you have friends plural You have one friend and shes a drunken slut.  Such a charming lady huh  There are some other things that bothered me but I want this rant to end. Im just going to say one more thing the plot is thin. Nothing happens and at the end we are thrown into a rushed ending where everything comes together. The twist was okay but there is no time to think about it because it already ends. Like out of nowhere.. Please stay away from this book. Such a disappointment because it had potential.;Michael  Grant Katherine Applegate

You will do this book injustice if you compare it with Harry Potter but this book held the same magic as HP her writingstyle.  There is something about the way Rowling writes a book that hooks you to the story no matter what. It took me some time to warm up for it and there are quite some characters which can be confusing in the beginning but eventually I couldnt put it down.  This is the story of a small community where we follow the lives of some characters. Its a story about lies secrets abuse rape  its not a happy tale but an important one. I was surprised by the language and some of the things that happened but Rowling pulls it off in a fantastic way. She nailed the characters they all had their own voice and personality.  Its not a book I will reread any time soon or perhaps ever but Im glad I finally gave it a shot (because of the book club);J.K. Rowling
444;13517455;4;236117;0062217070;Five years ago Wren Connolly was shot three times in the chest. After 178 minutes she came back as a Reboot stronger faster able to heal and less emotional. The longer Reboots are dead the less human they are when they return. Wren 178 is the deadliest Reboot in the Republic of Texas. Now seventeen years old she serves as a soldier for HARC (Human Advancement and Repopulation Corporation).Wrens favorite part of the job is training new Reboots but her latest newbie is the worst shes ever seen. As a 22 Callum Reyes is practically human. His reflexes are too slow hes always asking questions and his everpresent smile is freaking her out. Yet theres something about him she cant ignore. When Callum refuses to follow an order Wren is given one last chance to get him in lineor shell have to eliminate him. Wren has never disobeyed before and knows if she does shell be eliminated too. But she has also never felt as alive as she does around Callum.The perfect soldier is done taking orders.;365;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1350931774m13517455.jpg;Reboot (Reboot 1);youngadult;A virus action and kick ass characters. What else can you ask for There were some flaws but I couldnt put it down Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  I didnt requested this book when I emailed Sarah from HarperCollins but she was kind enough to provide a review copy from Reboot with the other books. And Im happy she did because it was exactly what I was looking for. A virus action kick ass characters and some romance thats how I like it  It has been a great year when it comes to Dystopian books so far. Ive had some disappointing books (Mila 2.0 and Fragments) but Reboot can claim a spot among Whats left of me Partials and Legend.  Summary.  The world is plagued by a virus which causes dead people to return to life. They reboot into a stronger faster and less emotional version and everybody is afraid of them. HARC is an organisation where new Reboots are trained and used in combat to protect humanity. Wren works for HARC and she is one of the strongest Reboots with her 178 minutes. The longer youre dead the less human you are. She likes to train new Reboots and she is one of the best because she can pick the highest numbers. That is until Callum 22 minutes appears and he makes her question about it is it because of the high number of because of her training She decides to pick him as her next student and she starts to get feelings for him. The annoying always questioning and smiling Callum helps her to retrieve her hidden humanity. So Wren does something she never did before she disobeys HARC when they give her the order to eliminate him. Its time to escape HARC to find the Reboot camp.  Review.  First of all virus I feel like I repeat myself but I love Dystopian books with biological backgrounds. This virus is the reason people return to a better version but Reboots are feared and used as slaves by humans. They are used to maintain order by capturing criminals and sick people. The worldbuilding was good. There was enough information to understand it but I could use even more details to have a complete picture.  Wren is one of the best Reboots but Callum is the opposite. With 22 minutes he is almost completely human and he doesnt like to take orders. Wrens trust in HARC is starting to crumble because of his endless questions. Callum is great. I liked how confident he is without being arrogant. He is a bit impulsive and disobedient thats why Wren is ordered to eliminate him. I admire his strength for standing up for his believes. Im happy that Wren decides to escape with him. It was fun to see her change because of Callum. Her change might have been a bit fast but it worked for me. This book is quite fastpaced so it never felt too forced. I liked Wren and her twosided personality. She can snap someones neck in a second but shes also blushing when Callum flirts with her. The softside makes her complete and much easier to connect with her.  There is a lot of action in this book  its not overwhelmed by a romantic plot. This is how you write a good Dystopian story. Im looking forward to the next book since it ends quite abrupt but satisfying.;Amy Tintera

I can understand her and I love how flawed and perfect she is at the same time.  Im still team Chaol but Im starting to see why there is also a team Dorian. They have a good chemistry and I like how they talk to each other but there is something about Chaol that is more attractive to me. Dorian is a bit too flirty and easy with the woman. Im more into broody mysterious guys like Chaol.  Another thing I appreciated again is the friendship between Celaena and Nehemia. They have something special and it was great to see how Celaena opened up for her. A girl stabbed her in the back in the past (something we got to see in one of the novellas) but Nehemia shows her to have hope. There is still something as friendship and Nehemia is kick ass too. I like how she stood up how she spies to protect her people and how she battled demons to protect Celaena.  Ahh wonderful book awesome writing but I hope to have a little more worldbuilding in part 2.;Sarah J. Maas

Around page 50 I was afraid this was one of those hypedbookeverybodylovesexceptme like Anna and the French kiss. This changed when I reached pages 124 and boy I was so wrong I was hooked by the mystery surrounding Karous true identity and all the secrets. This book was rich and detailed.  Summary.  Karou grew up in the care of three Chimeras. Brimstone was her father figure and he sends her on errands to collect teeth. Karou has no idea why but he gives her wishes in return. Wishes that can make her hair bright blue or give her annoying ex boyfriend itches in embarrassing places. Her world collapses when strange black hand prints appear on all her magic doorways. On a normal day she is thrown out of Brimstones shop. Confused and clueless Karou ends up in the presence of the angel Akiva. Can Karou unravel her true identity and the reason behind the attack on Brimstones shop  Review.  I was fascinated by Karou. She is a great character and I connected with her. How cool is it to have bright blue hair and the ability to travel to places by walking through a door I loved the little clues we get about who she truly is and I was surprised about the climax. Im not sure what I expected but it wasnt THAT. The romance between her and Akiva is so subtle. The attraction is always on the background and it served a purpose in the story line exactly how I like it. At the same time I thought it was a little too quick.  It was fun to figure out the meaning behind the teeth and the two different stories about the war between the Chimeras and the angels. This book is a bit more difficult than some YA Ive read lately in the sense of a good story with much background and information. The author really thought about her story and the world she created.  So if you decide to read this book and you have a meh start like me dont give up Its worth it. The ending was great and I cant wait to get started in part two.;Laini Taylor

What a fun story A curse magic assassins pirates and two interesting characters. I was swept away in this story and its almost impossible to imagine that this book is a debut  Summary.  Ananna of the Tanarau is married off to another pirate clan but instead of listening to the treats of her fiance she escapes on a stolen camel. Not long after that Ananna is followed by an assassin. When she accidently saves his life a curse is activated. The assassin called Naji is now bound to protect Ananna. Together they embark on a journey to break the curse but this is much harder than it seems. Naji is followed by people from the Mists and Ananna is now part of his trouble.  Review.  Every girl who manages to escape a marriage by stealing a camel is a girl who deserves my respect. I adored Ananna. Fierce daring and intelligent. She isnt afraid to stand up for herself and growing up on a pirate ship has made her strong and loyal. She can be a bit reckless but she is a very likable character. I like her growing feelings for Naji and how she is capable of seeing his beauty behind the scars. Naji is mysterious and interesting. I didnt connected with him as I much as I did with Ananna but I liked him. He is the perfect match for Ananna and Im happy that he wasnt perfect. He has a soft side and its obvious that he likes Ananna way more than he wants to admit.  The worldbuilding is good and filled with magic. There is blood magic like Naji or magic with elements like Anannas mother. It is very subtle because the real story is all about the curse. When they finally have the answer things seem impossible and I cant wait to see what they are going to do in part two Im also intrigued by the Mists and I want to find out more about this. Dont expect a dazzling ending though. The story never builds up and there isnt a real climax. I find it more a prologue  a step towards the real story but I wasnt disappointed. It fits with this story.;Cassandra Rose Clarke

This was again a book from Diener I really enjoyed. I think I can put her on the list of favorite authors now because her stories always deliver.  Summary.  Charlotte grew up with Lady Howe after her employer left her in the chimney. She always disguised herself as a boy but Lady Howe gave her a life as a woman. Otherwise she would still live a hard life on the streets with her friend Luke. He is now a London Crime Lord and he always protects her. Not that Charlotte needs it. This girl is feisty brave and intelligent enough to safe herself.  When Charlotte attends a ball she overhears Emma conversation with another woman. She warns Emma about a dark plan and the woman flees with her three boys. Emma tries to get help from her brother Edward. He is a powerful man of the crown but his behaviour pushes Emma away. Charlotte and Lady Howe are kind enough to let Emma and her boys stay with them as long as she likes.  Edward finds Charlotte and her story interesting. He is trying to gain more information about her and thats when Luke enters the story. He sees Edward as the enemy and he wants to eliminate him but Charlotte can interfere with this plan. It seems that Luke is part of a huge conspiracy. Huge amounts of money are leaving the country but who is behind this Edward is trying to find out what is going on and he needs Charlotte. Together they are trying to save England before it is too late.  Opinion.  Charlotte is a wonderful girl. She grew up as the (bastard) daughter of a prostitute but she managed to escape the same fate. Lady Howe saved her life by taking her in but Luke protected her on the streets. Two separate lives combined in one and Luke is giving her a hard time. He loves in a way she cant return and that is keeping her away from finding a husband.  Luckily Edward isnt planning to stay away from her. He is intrigued by Charlotte and they start to fall in love. Their conversations are fun and I loved to see how they grew to each other.  The only problem I had with this story is that its sometimes a bit slow. The conspiracy felt more like a background story. I had the idea that this book is more about Charlotte and her struggle with Luke and Edward. Its very entertaining dont get me wrong but I wished that the mystery played a bigger role. The plot was great though and the writingstyle is pleasant. I cant wait to read another book from Diener.;Michelle Diener

There are still original vampire stories Lily and her autistic twin sister Mel try to survive on one of the Farms surrounded buildings to protect them from the Ticks but they are used as kettle for their blood. These Ticks are humans infected with a virus turning them into a mix of a zombie and a vampire. When Lily and Mel try to escape a familiar face stops them. Carter is her high school crush from the Before and he tries to rescue young people together with vampire Stephen. He has saved a lot of people and they are save in a rebel camp but he doesnt tell why she (Lily) is so special to them.  I had a slow start but once I reached a certain point I couldnt put it down. There was something about this worldbuilding that fascinated me. The world is dark and grim humans are used for their blood and some of them are offered to the Ticks to keep them away from the fence. When Stephen and Carter take Mel Lily and two other young ones away its the start of a suspenseful trip. My heart went a bit faster in some scary situations and the Ticks are terrifying.  Lily isnt the best MC. She is sometimes a bit too whiny and selfish. She treats Mel more like a heavy burden but I like her for the fact that she changed that soon. You could definitely see that the girls love each other despite Mels autistic behaviour. The thing that annoyed me the most is her stubbornness. I do like it when a MC thinks for herself but she had to discuss EVERYTHING. Even Stephen who is supposed to be a two thousand year old vampire cant talk any sense into this girl. I wish he sometimes showed her his power and intelligence instead of bowing to her will.  We go left.  Why I want to go right.  Its not save.  Im going to do it anyway.  etc.  ARGI like the idea of a human weapon against the Ticks and the fact that someone is the mastermind behind the whole destroyed world. I cant wait to see how this is going to work out in part two The lair where Mel is going to be the MC. I recommend that you dont read the blurb from The lair because its spoils the ending of this book. And let me tell you I did not see it coming. It shocked me.;Emily McKay

This book was hard to rate I was thinking about a 2.5 rating but I dont have it anymore and 2 is too low.. In the end I based my 3 on two different ratings. Entertainment level 4 but the story itself deserves 2 stars. I thought it was a very quick and easy story to read with assassins and magic. But I had problem with the shallow plot and how the characters act. I didnt buy the romance and I was hoping for more action and depth.  Ileni is a brave seventeenyear old girl who is losing her magic. She grew up as a Renegai sorceress but her powers are starting to get weak and thats why she is sent to the Assassins cave. Assassins and magicians are living in peace with each other because of a pact there must always be a Renegai to train the assassins with potential magic powers. The latest two died in strange ways and its up to Ileni to find out what happened to them. Sorin grew up as assassin with the Master took him away from the streets. He has blind faith in the Master (the same with all the other assassins) and he will do anything to please him. He is tasked with the protection of Ileni and the two of them research the strange Renegais deaths.  I really liked how the story starts. I was immediately hooked by Ileni and her braveness. She is not afraid to die and it was sad to see how she tries to cope with the fact that the Renegais are willing to sacrifice her. She left a lover behind and I liked her struggle with her new feelings for Sorin. It was also interesting to see how she deals with the loss of her magical powers. The only thing is when Sorin and Ileni admit they like each other she turns into a soppy mess. I just wish she stayed true to herself like Sorin. It was hard to connect with him. His loyalty is creepy but also fascinating at the same time. The fact that someone is capable of gaining so much trust is crazy. I didnt like them together. There is something off about their chemistry and I was never swept away by their romance. It didnt felt genuine to me.  There is also the mystery behind the death of two Renegais. It adds a certain tension to the story especially with some of the dangerous assassins who arent trying to hide their hate for Ileni. The only thing is nothing really happens. Its more characterdriven with a hint of mystery and not the action I expect when I think of assassins. It was enjoyable and the ending makes me interesting for more but dont expect too much. Its a shame that the cover is prettier than the inside.;Leah Cypess
452;13554713;4;236117;067002497X;Two hundred years ago Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm published the first volume of Childrens and Household Tales. Now at a veritable fairytale momentwitness the popular television shows Grimm and Once Upon a Time and this years two movie adaptations of Snow WhitePhilip Pullman one of the most popular authors of our time makes us fall in love all over again with the immortal tales of the Brothers Grimm.From muchloved stories like Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin Rapunzel and Hansel and Gretel to lesserknown treasures like BriarRose Thousandfurs and The Girl with No Hands Pullman retells his fifty favorites paying homage to the tales that inspired his unique creative visionand that continue to cast their spell on the Western imagination.;405;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1339554952m13554713.jpg;Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm A New English Version;fantasy paranormal;Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  This book is a dream for every fairytale lover. Pullman took fifty of his favorites stories from the Brothers Grimm and he bundled them into this book. The only reason why I gave it 4 flowers instead of 5 is the fact that I expected more input from Pullman. We get a lot of extra information and background story at the end of each story and I loved that but the fairytales are still the same. He didnt retell them although he made some adjustments.  One of the things I loved was the fact that I discovered some new stories and I met some old favorites. I always hope that there are authors out there using these less familiar fairytales. Let me give you an examples I will tell you my short version  The three little men in the wood. There are two sisters. One if beautiful and kind the other is ugly and mean. Their mother hates the first sister her stepdaughter. One day she dresses the girl in paper and sent her out in the snow to search for strawberries. The girl meets three little men. She shares her old hard bread with them and they ask her to help them when she does they see the goodness in her heart and they reward her with gifts. Every day the girl will get prettier and whenever she speaks gold coins will tumble out of her mouth. Their last gift is that one day she will marry a king. The stepmother is furious and the stepsister is envious she wants the same fortune. With warm clothing the girl walks the same path and meets the three little men. She refuses to share her good food and she doesnt want to help them. They punish her every day she will get uglier and whenever she speaks toads will fall out of her mouth. Their last punishment is that she will die a miserable death. I think you can see where this story is going to.  Some other stories are Oneeye twoeyes and threeeyes where twoeyes gets bullied by her sisters and mother because she is so normal. I used to reread that story often when I was younger. The singing springing lark sounds like Beauty and the Beast but this time the enchanted prince is a lion and he takes his human shape in the night.  There are of course the popular and wellknown stories like Rapunzel Hansel and Gretel Cinderella Little red riding hood Briar Rose Snow white and Rumpelstiltskin. It surprised me that he didnt pick The little mermaid.  If you are obsessed with fairytales like me this is the book you want to read Im definitely going to buy a copy (dont you just love this cover)  So one day when the queen asked her mirror  Mirror mirror on the wall  Who in this land is the fairest of all  The mirror answered  Your majesty you are still lovely its true  But Snow White is a thousand times fairer than you.;Philip Pullman Jacob Grimm Wilhelm Grimm

Ahhhh my love for fairytales drooled when I saw this cover and blurb. I mean beauty and the beast retelling with a paranormal twist Sounds great to me and this story definitely delivered something new.  Cecelia hates prince Alexander (and she has some good reasons for that) but she befriends a talking wolf. She doesnt know that the wolf is actually Alexander who was punished by a witch. He has one year to find someone to love him in this condition. Although its strange that someone can fall in love with a wolf I still liked the moral of this story. The wolf is a good friend after all and I like his advices. The writingstyle is nothing fancy just fastpaced and quick. This is a book you want to read when you are busy because its fun and easy.;Jenni James

I liked this book but I wasnt blown away. The beginning is terribly slow. The story takes a lot of time to get started and that made it hard to enjoy this book. I thought about DNFing this book but in the end it was okay. The ending was interesting and I might read the next book.  Rayna sees wings. She has been in therapy for over three years now and she has to take medication. After a couple of months Rayna is free to leave the institute to start fresh at school. In an attempt for a normal life Rayna takes a job but the wings are starting to return. When a new boy in her class has wings Rayna loses her mind. But what she doesnt know is that she truly sees Angels and they are here for a reason. A dark fallen Angel is forcing teenagers to suicide to build an army and when he discovers that Rayna can see him she isnt save anymore.  There are three characters who play a big role. There is of course Rayna. Im a bit confused about my feelings for her. I can understand that its terrible if you can see things no one else can but her reactions were a bit over the top for me. She is so jumpy in class and she expects everyone to look at her like she is strange and crazy. They dont even know her problems but her actions can make them think that way. I just wish she was a bit stronger but she stays whiny.  Then there is Cam the new boy Angel. He is there to protect a classmate from Rayna and this is lovepotential one. I didnt really care for him. And last but not least fallen angel Kade. He is a good bad guy he dropped out of Heaven because he fell in love with a human. The nasty part That human was Raynas mother and now he is flirting with her... I liked him although he completed the cliche. One special girl two loveinterests one good guy one slightly bad guy.  So it was disappointing but not a bad book.;Lisa M. Basso

I hate to say this because I follow the author on Instagram and she seems sweet but I disliked this book. The writingstyle romance plot and characters didnt work for me at all.. The only reason this book has 2 stars is because it was enjoyable. This book has that I dont like it but I still cant stop reading factor so that does count for something. Plus the blurb didnt lie when it said actionpacked and bloodsoaked. It only forgot to include that the overall story is boring.  This book is told from the POV of Meadow and Zephyr. The first problem is that every chapter switches back and forth between them but they dont have distinctive voices. It was hard to connect with either of them and it felt too chaotic. Sometimes those switches prevented me from being wrapped into the story and I think it would have been better to stick with Meadow  or at least only a couple of chapters from Zephyrs POV. The writingstyle also felt.. chunky. Its not fluent like you might see in some of the quotes I use later on.  The plot started out interesting but soon follows some of the basic Dystopian storylines. I wish the author had been a little more creative because the idea of training people for The murder complex to keep the world from overgrowing was good. The fact that its not inventive enough makes it a little predictable and I was never blown away by situations that might be meant as surprises.  But I could live with these aspects. The thing that annoyed me to no end were the swear worlds. Not only do I dislike it when authors come up with own made words (although sometimes it does work out) Zephyr uses them EVERY SENTENCE. Flux I kept rolling my eyes and gritting my teeth so that made it hard to enjoy his chapters.  A7. A8. Their faces are dead. Devoid of all emotion. Like machines. Its bullskitz.  (Whats up with this sentence)  And what is a Dystopian book without the dreaded instalove I should have known when he talked about how it was faith that they met each other and Instead all I can think is I might love this girl. What about this cliche line  I want to believe you she whispers. Its like Ive known you all my life.  I know Michael I know..  The characters werent that bad. Meadow has learned to defend herself by her father and she has some great moves up her sleeves. She doesnt shy away from violence or killing to save herself or her family but she does have the tendency to be a bit rash and she suffers from the sacrificesyndrome.

Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  Finally I was so happy when the publisher accepted my request on Netgalley. Ive been dying to read this book after my love for The immortal rules  and this book definitely didnt disappoint me. If there is one author who knows how to write an engaging story its Kagawa.  Needless to say I loved the characters. Allie is back we get to see Zeke and Jackal is added to the cast. Im happy that Kanin plays a bigger role in this story and damn Sarren is one of the scariest characters Ive encountered in a while. Allie is a bit different though. She sometimes borders on the line of becoming a whiner. She feels guilty about the monster inside her and she is constantly worrying about Kanin and Zeke. I liked her much more after they find Kanin but Jackals presence lightened everything up. He is sarcastic and he accepted who he is. He made me laugh a couple of times and I like how complex and unpredictable he is.  Zeke Zeke He couldnt have been any more adorable. He completely accepts Allie for who she is and he is such a brave and tough guy. Zeke and Allie are perfect together.I did have some trouble with the pacing. I was really hooked to the story around 64 a bit late. The book starts with Allies search for Kanin. She stumbles on Jackal first and together they try to find their sire. This part was a bit slow. Their dialogues were fun but most of the story is about Allies struggle with acceptance. When they find Zeke in one of the most unexpected places it started to get interesting. This group of unlike partners find Kanin and this is where the true action and story kicks in. They need to hunt down Sarren  a psychopath who gave me the shivers. From his horrible appearance to his maniacal actions he is the perfect villain.  THE ENDING. OH MY So cruel and awesome at the same time This is how you write a cliffhanger. I liked the action and the tension now and then but I expected a bit more bloody and gore scenes. This together with the somewhat slow pacing made this book a 4 instead of a 5. But Im still looking forward to the last book the forever song Its going to be epic D.;Julie Kagawa

Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2....  I really liked A tale dark and Grimm (although the rating is a bit too high now but I dont like to edit old ratings. Id probably give it a 3.5 stars too) and I was looking forward to this book. I was not disappointed Gidwitz has a great way in creating a story made out of several fairytales. Everything blends together and forms this fun and creative book. I also like the wisdom when the MCs start to realize something important about themselves. Its good when a book has an underlying moral.  Summary.  Jack and Jill are the main characters in this book. Jill is the daughter of a mean and appearance obsessed Queen. One day Jill is laughed at by her people when she walks naked in public and she runs away to her nephew Jack. On her way she befriends the talking frog.  Jack is a dreamer. He is bullied by the popular boys in the village and he longs to be one of them. His father wants to make a man out of him and sends him with their cow to the market. Instead of selling her for money Jack returns with a magic bean. His father is furious and that leads Jack and Jill to make a stupid decision. When an old woman asks them to find a seeing glass they accept the deal. If they cant find it they will die. If they return it they are granted their wish. Jack will be loved by everyone and Jill will be the most beautiful girl in the world.  Together they go on an adventure which will bring them high in the sky with giants and down below the earth with goblins and a huge salamander. There are many dangerous times but Jack and Jill are learning one important thing in life.  Review.  This book tackles one of my favorite things when it comes to retellings originality. The use of the different fairytales was so much. Its great when you can search for the true stories. What I also like is the fact that he integrates fairytales from different authors. Not only the Brothers Grimm but authors like Hans Christian Andersen and the nursery rhymes from Mother Goose. The Brothers Grimm are the popular and we sometimes forget that there are more great fairytale authors.  Jack and Jill are great and easy to connect with. They are insecure and a bit lonely I think we all know how that feels. It wasnt hard to understand their choice to help the old woman. Their journey is exciting. There is a lot of action. I really like the friendship between Jack Jill and the frog and how they find a way to get out of dangerous situations.  One thing to warn you this is not a sequel. A tale dark and Grimm and this one are only connected because of the use of fairytales but they can be read as standalones. I never expected this to be a sequel but you could be disappointed if you did. Keeps in mind that this book is also a mixture between YA and MG its hard to pinpoint the exact genre.;Adam Gidwitz

Michelle Zink  A ribbon of blue.  Ruby is waiting for the carnival. She is suffering from CP but someone promised her a long time ago that she would find a cure at the carnival.  Nancy Holder Part first The lion  the unicorn.  I felt so sad when I discovered that Part two is only available in the published version. It was really good.  Opinion.  The other stories were just okay. There was nothing special about them. Wellwritten but forgettable. I blame it on the fact that I couldnt connect with the characters so perhaps its just me ) The stories I loved managed to give me something extra. A original twist a character that could surprise me or just a great way of playing with words.  I wished that the stories were scarier. There were two that frightened me but that wasnt enough.

I am left frustrated and confused by this book. I liked the idea of a community in Alaska after World War III the only thing is Juneau finds out this never happened. I thought it would give some interesting situations with Juneau trying to blend into the modern world and her mission to save her clan. Instead I was bored and it seemed to take me a lot of time to finish it. The slow pacing doesnt work here. I am familiar with her other series so I know she likes her cliffhangers but this ending felt too abrupt.  Juneau grew up with the knowledge she was going to be the next clan leader. She is capable of Reading which is done with the energy from Yara. Whit is her guide but everything he ever told her appears to be a lie. When Juneau returns from hunting her clan is kidnapped and people are looking for her. She runs into Miles which is just such a stupid coincidence. He is looking for her because his father is after her and Miles hopes to get some credits. This leads to a lot of the same traveling escaping and running.  I disliked how Miles is able to find Juneau that easily. She changed her looks so there is no way he could recognize her after that transformation. It was something that happened to make the story unravel but it was by no means realistic. Also Juneau grew up in isolation but she is able to drive a car without any problem  Juneau and Miles obviously dont trust each other but they are aware they need each other at the same time. Miles is the blissfully ignorant spawn of the rich and Juneau is a paranoid schizophrenic. Its not long before they start to get feelings even when Juneau had some clever moments where she tells herself that there is no time for a stupid teenage boy. But like many other weak Dystopian MCs she soon falls for his charm.  I feel okay about both characters. They arent the best but Ive encountered worse characters. I felt a little disconnected from them and the interesting plot around Juneaus reading powers doesnt get to shine. The slow pace kills everything and that is a shame. Most annoying about this book The fact that the ending makes me want to read the sequel.;Amy Plum

Paige is still fabulous Warden is mysterious and interesting  I love all the thought that went into the story.  Bumping up my rating to 4.5 stars )    Complex and highly confusing in the beginning but I did like the intricate world. Paige is a wonderful character )  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Im going to be honest and say that I had some difficulty understanding this complex and rich worldbuilding. I still have the idea I didnt get half of it and this made it hard to connect with the story in the beginning. I felt overwhelmed by all the terms and information but luckily the characters made up for it  Because of the complexity Im not going to summarize much of this book. It all starts with Paige and her secret job at Scion London for Jaxon the mimelord of I4. He has his gang of voyants and Paige is one of a kind a dreamwalker. She is able to break into someones mind by walking in their dreamscape  and she can kill or possess someone if she gets powerful enough. When her gift is discovered she is taken away to Sheol I and placed under the eye of Warden the bloodconsort. The ruler of Sheol I is after Paiges gift and she is soon fighting for her life.  There are many different types of voyants and its explained but I couldnt wrap my mind around everything. Add new terms that are thrown into the mix and it can be confusing. This book almost crossed a line for me where there was too much information. It was interesting and different from anything Ive seen so far but I hope that the next book is less overwhelming. Im interesting to see how Samantha is going to write 7 books  One thing I liked were the fleshed out characters. Paige is 19 years and that made it easy to connect with her agewise. She is strong and I liked her spirit. She isnt one to whine and she is very protective. I loved her power and how she starts to grow into it. Her bonding with Warden was fun to watch. She is very suspicious of him but he is also fascinating to her. Their blooming friendship and romance was adorable and I like how the romance completed the story.  The ending is conclusive but also leaves a gap that makes me excited for more. If you are looking for a YA that almost feels like an adult book with a good romance interesting worldbuilding and action this is a book for you. If you want a better review I suggest you take a look at this one from Sam  Realm of fiction 4 star review of The bone season.;Samantha Shannon

I really liked it. Another original retelling about Sleeping beauty. I havent read anything with this paranormal twist before. Aleyna has been put into a sleep by the unicorn Ezralon. He is waiting for the perfect time to wake her and he is also protecting her from harmful memories. In the mean time he let her ghosts wander in a fantasy world where she is surrounded by people.  Darien is challenged by his friends to find Aleyna. There is a myth about her ghosts and Darien despite his fear of ghosts decides to put it to the test. He doesnt believe the stories until he falls in love with Aleynas ghosts. I liked that Sleeping beauty is in an induced sleep to keep her protected and the battle was good. Aleyna is a girl with great spirit and I liked her chemistry with Darien. Its a pretty severe case of instalove but thats what you can expect from such a short fairytale.;Jenni James

Let one thing be clear Victoria knows how the write. I fell in love with A darker shade of magic and I also really liked The Archived and The near witch. I think this book ended up being a little disappointed because I was expecting more from it. The love I felt for ADSOM and the raving reviews for this book made me think it was going to be epic and while it was good I wasnt fully blownaway by it. Christina also made me look differently at some things and she opened up my eyes for things that could have been better.  Plenty of humans were monstrous and plenty of monsters knew how to play at being human.  This book is written from different time periods and I appreciate how natural the flow felt. I never had the idea that it was too jumpy or that it didnt make any sense. This way of telling the story gave us little clues until everything falls together  and I love that. Its difficult to achieve such a thing which is further prove that Victoria is a gifted author.  We get to see 10 years before when Victor and Eli are friends studying medicine. Eli choose EOs (ExtraOrdinary) as his thesis subject. Victor believes its only a joke but Eli is hellbound on proving his hypothesis that EOs exist. Victor takes it a step further when Eli explains his theory of gaining superpowers when you have a nearlydeath experience (NDE). He wants to be a test subject. Their first attempt fails miserably and Victor ends up in the hospital but they learn from their mistakes and Eli later returns with his special power. Victor undertakes his own attempt because Eli no longer wants to help him and this is where things go wrong. Fastforward where we see Victor escaping from prison teaming up with Mitch and Sydney to find Eli and destroy him. We see Elis belief that he has a mission on this earth given to him by God and how he works together with Serena another EO.  The story constantly builds up toward the end battle between Eli and Victor. I loved seeing the start of their friendship and how they are both attracted to each other in a dark way. It was interesting to see the theory behind EOs but Christina pointed out that there are many flaws in the scientific explanations. Like how it doesnt make any sense that your last thought has any influence on the gained superpower. The buildup was nicely done but the conclusion was a bit of a letdown. It wasnt very unexpected even when the characters used a clever strategy.  I felt very disconnected from the characters. I am not sure if that was the purpose from Victoria (and if so she succeeded) but as result it made me feel disconnected from the story. Victor and Eli could have been fascinating characters but they were undeveloped in my opinion. Victor has this constant depressing mood and Eli has a twisted darkness behind his smile. They are both highly intelligent and EOs but thats practically all I know about them.  The highlight of this book is definitely the writing. No matter what Victoria writes Im always hooked. She has an easy style that sucks you right into the story. It made me forget about the fact that Im reading. Best feeling So I might not have loved this book as much as I thought I would its still very good and recommended.  I also read the novella called Warmup which can be read for free over here Tor.com. Its a great way to meet Victorias writing for the first time. There are no spoilers for Vicious and its an interesting story.;V.E. Schwab Victoria Schwab

First thoughts after finishing this book WOAH what an amazing book. This is definitely the best book Ive read with a medical aspect. I loved it Being a soontobemicrobiologist I felt very happy when I saw the wellwritten information. It was realistic and I can see that Grant did a lot of research. This resulted in a creepy and believable story. There were some very intense scenes where my heart sped up and Im looking forward to see where this story is going to lead me.  The chapters are split into two different subjects the first one are pieces of interviews and the beginning of the development of the tapeworm. It added a lot of background to the story and it completed the worldbuilding. I liked seeing the start of the research and the precise reason they invented this tapeworm.  The second part is about Sally  now Sal  who woke up after being declared brain dead. She was involved in an accident and her parents were informed shed never wakeup. But she did and now six years later Sal is followed by the engineers from the tapeworm Symbogen. They still dont understand how its possible that she survived and they keep testing her. She has amnesia and must attend a psychologist to find her old personality back because Sal is nothing like the old Sally. Sal is trying to find her way in this world and she has a great boyfriend called Nathan a microbiologist.  I really liked these two characters. Sal is ready to break free from her stamp and she has spunk. She is intelligent and I loved her nonwhiny personality. Nathan is a sweetheart and it was fun to have an existing relationship. In YA we always have a lot of romance and instalove but here we have two people who are already in love. Refreshing.  The tapeworm is a puzzle made from different pieces of DNA. Almost everyone has one in their intestines to keep them healthy and safe from any diseases. This is pretty gross if you think about it. Were always trying to keep our bodies clean from dangerous parasites and everyone carries voluntarily a worm inside them. But so far so good until many people develop a strange symptom. Its called sleepwalking. People suddenly turn into some sort of zombies and they even start to get violent. Nobody knows whats going on and I liked the tension this gives. Symbogen is already looking for answers but they keep everything quiet.  Sal is done with the secrecy and when she gets an anonymous offer for answer she and Nathan decide to take it. They are warned that the information is going to change their perspective of the tapeworm but Sal wants to find out whats going on. This part is sick and I was amazed. I was already starting to question some things about Sal and I was right (hence the 4.5 stars) but it was still magnificent and scary.  I guess thats what you can expect when humans are playing for God. I really wish I could read part two right now because the ending makes me so curious and hungry for more. Mira Grant knows how the write an engaging story. Two thumbs up for her research and writingstyle. I have at least another series (Feed) to read in the time Ill be waiting for part 2.;Mira Grant

Despite the fact that I sort of liked this book I was also disappointed. I expected more and it was less creepy than I anticipated. Knowing the real story I was hoping to get more excitement. There are hardly any retellings about this tale (Ive only seen it mentioned in one book before) so I was hoping to get a really good book. Instead I got a story that wasnt rememorable.  Summary  When Sophias father dies he leaves her her sister and her two brothers behind as orphans. Sophia is lucky enough to have a rich godfather. She hopes to help her family by moving in his mansion. He is very charming and he overwhelms her with expensive gifts. Sophia is starting to see him not only as a godfather but as a man. But something is not right and his facade is slowly starting to crumble. Sophia feels smothered by his possessive nature and she is afraid for his explosive temper. He practically forces her to marry him and that is when she finds out about his greatest secret. His other wives didnt die from a natural cause and he isnt planning to let Sophia leave.  Review  What bothered me is the fact that her father never questioned why his friend only wants to be godfather of Sophia. He admits that Bernard has strong affections from Sophia but he never thinks this is strange What about his other children I wouldve tried to arrange something for them as well but that would have changed the complete story of course.  Sophia is not a bad character in the beginning. She is shy and she seemed intelligent but I didnt like the way she changed herself to please Bernard. I can see why she was falling for him. He was kind interested in her opinion and he makes her feel safe and wanted but that doesnt mean you need to do things that make you feel embarrassed. I wished she showed more of the spunk she has at the end. Throughout the story I was bored by her and I didnt feel connected to her. There were times she annoyed me.  Bernard. Its clear that he is out of his mind but I think that grief changed him in the person he is now. I liked how Nickerson painted his split personality. It makes him a villain you dont hate a 100 and it makes him a more realistic treat. I think he cares for Sophia in his own twisted way. There are also some secondary characters while they have their distinct role I find them a bit underdeveloped.  Nickerson has a pleasant writingstyle. Its detailed and easy. It wasnt hard to imagine how the characters and the environment looks. I liked the plot but I already knew that since Im familiar with the original story. Its such a morbid tale. The ending held some of the tension I expected earlier. It was satisfying and fairytaleish good wins evil loses. I just wished I felt more creepiness in the overall story.;Jane Nickerson

This book is amazing. Excuse me for fangirling but it has been a while since Ive read such a fantastic YA fantasy series. There is absolutely nothing to criticize and I highly recommend this. I tried to read this book as slowly as possible because I didnt want it to end. It was hard.  Anything worth doing always starts with a bad idea.  Alina and Mal are on the run for The Darkling but they are captured and transported on Sturmhonds ship. Sturmhond has a plan on his own and Alina ends up in the Royal Palace where she can lead the Second Army  at least whats left of them. The Darkling doesnt give up though and he is even more dangerous with his new founded power. Alina has one more amplifier to find if they want to stand a chance against his army. I love this plot and the worldbuilding. Its creative and wellwritten. Its not hard to get swept away and the writingstyle is easy and detailed. The whole Geisha business is still fascinating.  I have so many good qualities Sturmhond said. It can be hard to choose.  One of my favorite aspects of this book are the characters. Let me start with a new character because he is freaking amazing. Sturmhond is mysterious and sarcastic. I love his quick and witty replies. His dialogues with Alina made me laugh out loud and you have to fall in love with him. I liked the twists around his character and his multiple faces.  The deal was only for kicking. It did not prohibit slapping punching biting or cutting you in half.  Alina was already a fantastic character but its possible that she got even more spunk than in Shadow and bone. She is starting to grow into her role as the Sun Summoner and she is tough. I like how she stands up for herself and how she leads the Second Army despite her fear. She is still intelligent and I liked her soft side. It makes her realistic and likable.  You know for two people with a love eternal youre awfully insecure.  The quote above is the perfect way to describe Mal. I honestly didnt care for him in this story. While I saw him as a potential lover in the first book I wanted him to leave the stage here. He holds Alina back and he hurts her with his actions. How can he be so blind He cares more about their relationship than for their country and its time he starts to understand that Alina is important. She is the one to free Ravka. He is distrustful and ignorant.  The Darkling plays a small but intriguing role. His character is a constant treat and I liked the suspension it gives. His new army is terrifying and I start to see him as a villain now. Some of his actions are horrible. The ending is good but there is a slight cliffhanger so  I NEED RUIN AND RISING.;Leigh Bardugo

How am I supposed to write a review about this book This story gave me so many emotions but most of all it left me confused. I still have mixed feelings and right after finishing I felt the need to cry. I think its because it wasnt everything I wanted it to be. Instead of the great ending I expected I got something cliched and it lost the creativity Bardugo showed me several times throughout the series.  But at the same time I got a lot of sassiness from one of my favorite characters Sturmhond background story from two fascinating characters adorable romantic moments and a kickass Alina. The one thing that didnt surprise me was my growing hate for Mal.  From here on there are SPOILERS for the entire series. Dont continue if you havent read all 3 books.    First of Nikolai my love His sentences make me giggle out loud and I simply adore him. Bardugo should write a book about him because I dont think I would ever get tired of his humor. The things that happened freaked me out and Im sad how he didnt get the happy ending I had in mind.  The romance between GenyaDavid (his speech) and TamarNatalie were awesome. I never thought about shipping those last two and I was surprised at how natural it felt. I only wish they got more story. Genya also shows what a strong character she is. How she stood up against the king amazing.  Now on to my most hated character Mal. The moment he left her alone in Siege and Storm showed me that his pretty words are nothing but bullshit. Saying you are always there for a person and that you care about them  and acting like it are two separate things. He continues this despicable behaviour with pride in Ruin and rising. There were so many times where I wanted Alina to Cut him the Darkling to rip him apart with his shadows or any other way to just get him out of the way. He is incredibly selfish not only towards Alina but also for Ravka. Multiple times he claims how he wishes Alina to lose her powers because now she is so strong she doesnt need him. Because yes that is what Mal needs. A vulnerable weak Alina he can protect to make him feel manly. I didnt like the extra role he was given and how he has ties with The Darkling. It felt.. convenient and unnecessarily.  Im happy that Alina accepts her powers. I loved her battle against the dark side of her powers and how she is able to understand the Darkling in a way no one else can. She is a wonderful character despite her horrible taste in man. The thing about the ending is that it brings her back to the person she was when we started this adventure. I have the idea it was all a bit for nothing and it left a hole in the story. I even wrote my own ending and I will forever keep it that way because its the only way I can deal with this disappointing feeling I have.  Alina kills Mal chops of his hand to have his amplifyer power gets into a fight with the Darkling aka Harry Potter clashes with Voldemort in the last book. She defeats him and after that the Fold disappears and she loses the amplifyers. Mal stays dead of course Alina keeps her powers but its normal like any other Grisha and she marries Sturmhond to help him dealing with the darkness that is left after the shadows. They rule Ravka honest and live happily ever after with their two children a boy called Mal (because okay he is part of her past) and a girl called Baghra.  Her moments with The Darkling were my favorite parts. So intense and I like him as a character. His death made an impact on me and while I get that he had to die I still missed him in the end. He reminds me so much of Voldemort I think he did all the things because he really believed in it.  There you have it. Ive rewritten this review three times now and Im still not happy with it. Its more a rant than a glowing fangirl moment  which I was hoping for. Nonetheless one of the best fantasy series and it will keep its place on my favorite shelf.;Leigh Bardugo

Im not sure what is going on but most of the books Ive been reading lately are meh. I was in need of a book to blow me away and I was hoping to find it in The queens choice. Unfortunately it wasnt what I was looking for. This book ended up being a slowpaced story where almost nothing happens. I never had the feeling I was sucked into the story and I was always looking for more.  The first thing where this book goes wrong for me is the plot. Its very thin and with the sickening slow pace its not the most exciting tale. With a magical place where the fey live next to our land the search for a lost prince and the hunt on fairies I was hoping to get something more interesting. The worldbuilding was definitely good but the promise failed to deliver.  Anya who is chosen to be the heir after the announcement that the Queen will die soon loses her wings when she ventures into the human world. She hopes to find the prince before her cousin Illumina does. She teams up with a human girl called Mary and this is where all the problems start. Her time in Chrior was good but things went downhill in our land. The two of them definitely know how to get into difficult situations but I never felt any tension or excitement. Things just happened they fixed it and they moved on. There was never a climax and with 512 pages I would have expected more.  The next problem is my disconnection with any of the characters. I liked some but I dont have the idea I know them. Illumina was by far the most fascinating with her desire to carve things into her body and her weird almost crazy way of thinking. Anya isnt a bad character either. She is strong and I like how determined she is. At the same time she is a bit too rash and jumps easily into dangerous situations. Her sidekick MaryShae was okay. She has her way with words and I like that she did everything to protect her family.  I want to give credits for the fact that Kluver stayed away from any fairy cliches and that there is hardly any romance. Anya is already in a relationship and her tension for a human guy was a nice addition. It would have been much better with less pages and more engaging developments. The ending provided a twist and combined with the good writingstyle it might be enough to make me read the next installment.;Cayla Kluver

The sister who knows how to rule and the one who is constantly reminded that she has not been marked for a grand destiny. But Alodia has plans and she will be the greatest queen her people have ever known. So she travelswith her hopeless naive chosen sisterto a distant part of their land to begin to secure her supporters. This region needs its princesses for it is plagued with a curse. The crops dont grow the spring doesnt arrive and a fierce jaguar stalks the shadows leaving only empty homes splashed with blood behind. If Alodia can save them no one will be able to deny her strength and her sovereignty.But what she discovers could change the fate of her kingdom if not her world.

Rae Carson knows how to write. After reading part one I fell in love with her writingstyle and she managed to create another fantastic story in only 54 pages. It made me extra excited for her second book  which I hope to get soon  Alodia is Crown Princess of Orovalle and she is the older sister from Elisa the girl we met in The girl of fire and thorns. They are on their way to a wedding from an important man Paxon protects the borders with his castle. Alodia wants to regain the loyalty and trust from him and her people in his region when she becomes Queen. Her father spent a lot of money in his war against Invierne en and the people are suffering. There is only one problem Paxon might not marry his beloved bride because there are rumours she is cursed. Alodia decides to investigate the matter together with Zito but she might lose more than she can gain.  What surprised me is how invested I became with Alodia en Zito. I cared for them even when I didnt know them that well. It was also great to see how Alodias opinion about Elisa changed at the end. Another things I appreciated was the fact that you can read this book as a standalone. You can follow the story if you havent read The girl of fire and thorns before. Its a good way to meet her writingstyle.  Conclusion This was such a wellwritten addition to the series. Rae Carson has earned her spot on my list of favorite authors.;Rae Carson

You. Kidding. Me You hace no idea how mad I am now. This is one of the worst endings Ive seen i a while. iwhduebsf. I cant.. arg Review (better rant) coming soon.    httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book.. I dont even know where to get started. There are two types of reviews I find hard to write books I absolutely love and books I find so terrible I hate them with a fierce passion. This book falls in the last category. Its almost unworthy of the 1.5rating but despite the truly horrible ending the middle part isnt that bad  hence the 1.5 flowers. This book is the perfect example of How to destroy a complete series I will never recommend this series because of this ending.  There is not much to say about the story anyway. Eve works together with the rebels and Mose gives her an important task she must kill her father. When her father finds out Eve flees with a couple of girls to take them to the safe haven Califia. When they arrive there Eve returns to complete the murder. This is where the whole book collapses.  First I didnt like Eve that much in the other books but she might be even worse here. She is pregnant from Caleb but Charles is protecting her by claiming its his child. He does everything for her but Eve is acting like a bitch. Charles didnt deserve her attitude she seems to forget he is forced to marry her too. Its not like he had a choice either. She tries to act like a leader but I found her whiny and annoying. The fact that she tries to stay kind to everyone almost spoils her attempt to flee with some girls.  Second the story dragged a little although I quite liked the plot. The rebels infiltrated the system Eve trying to murder her father and the riots everywhere. There was enough action and scheme to make it interesting. The only thing that continuously annoyed me where old characters that kept popping up with no particular role. The story would have been better without these dontmattersituations.  Third THE ENDING. I suggest you dont read this if you are planning to read this book.  SPOILER SPOILER  WHY why would you bring Caleb back into the story It seems like a very sad attempt to give Eve a happy ending but boy this spoiled everything. And dont leave it hanging like that We dont get to see them meeting each other or how things continue after this. What is going to happen to the city the schools the riots It feels like someone tore the last pages of my book. I still cant believe someone would end a book like this  It still makes me mad.

Review coming soon.  Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  This book was good. It was fun original and sweet but I still had some things I would have loved to see different. The beginning of this book was incredibly strong. I was hooked to the characters and their storylines but the story started to drag a little towards the ending. Their endless No Im not falling in love started to annoy me. Also be aware of the fact that the religion aspect is very important in this book. Sophie is a strong believer and there is a lot of talk about forgiving your enemy. Sometimes it was a bit too much for me.  The story is told from the third POV and switches very subtle between different storylines. I liked that a lot because we get to know more about the whole situation. We see how Gabe and his brother Valten find out about Sophie and her real identity and then we see how illtreated Sophie is. Gabe decides that he wants to rescue her but he has no idea how dangerous Duchess Ermengard is. She rules her land with an iron fist and she is obsessed with her looks the main reason why she hates Sophie so much.  Gabe is a complex character. He wants to save Sophie to prove himself to his parents. He is the second son so he doesnt have responsibilities like his brother Valten. Let me just say that Gabe used to enjoy life with his friends. He is brave and a good loveinterest. It was fun to see how hard he is trying to not fall in love with Sophie. Sophie was sometimes a bit too perfect but you have to like her. She has such a sweet spirit but also her moments of kickassness. She was smart and I liked her thoughtfulness. It would have been better if she was a bit more flawed (and I dont count the inability to dance as a flaw) but she was an interesting character.  It was a shame that we dont get to meet the Seven. They have names and they have their purpose but they are on the background. I wish they got more time to shine. Then of course Duchess Ermengard. I loathed her She is the perfect villain. From the descriptions of her disgusting appearance to her hateful nature she made me want to punch her in the face.  Overall a book that made me interested in her other work.;Melanie Dickerson

I was warned by some bloggers that they were disappointed by this book so that might be the reason I was surprised. I thought it was a solid conclusion and liked that this is story is split into two books. Sometimes its fun to have something else than a trilogy. There are no spoilers for the first book.  This book continues right after the first book. Naji and Annana are waiting on the island for Marjani to save them. When Annana stumbles on a Manticore there is only one thing she can do she makes a deal. In the mean time Naji has fallen in a depression. He has three impossible tasks to do if he wants to break the curse. Annana knows she can help him with one but is she ready to show Naji her feelings  I liked the idea of the three tasks and its an exciting journey. One of these tasks almost kills Naji (which the Mists would like because they are still present and waiting to murder him) and Annanas blood saves him. It was interesting to see how their blood bond was incorporated. The blood magic made me feel a bit.. uncomfortable sometimes. I really liked the last quest and Id love to be able to breathe underwater The plot was good and I liked the ending. Its not just a happilyeverafter it fits the story perfectly.  Its a shame that there is little background story when it comes to the Mists. We know that Naji stopped one of them from entering this world but I wish we got to know more about them. It feels like it was added to give the story more suspense but it fell flat to me.  The Manticore was a great character and it was a shame that her role is so small. It was fun to see her different perception of the world like humans being slaves to please her. There are also some other characters present like Marjani and her lover but they arent very developed.  One of the things that bothers me the most is the lack of chemistry between Annana and Naji. He never shows his true feelings and its hard to know what he thinks. I dont really get Annanas attraction to him and I wish he was more appealing and likable. I understand that he was supposed to be mysterious but it made me feel a bit disconnected from him.

I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book. There were things I liked (realistic portrayal of the disease) and things I disliked (Harveys blind admiration and Alices unlikable personality) In the end I think its just a good book but not one I would reread or highly recommend.  You have to keep your mind with this book. Its written with a constant switch between Alicenow Alicethen Harveynow and Harveythen. I thought the blend of nowthen was welldone but it also prevented me from connecting with the characters. I constantly had to pay attention to who and where I was and it distracted me from the real story. I think Alicenow and Alicethen would have been enough to create a good image of her story.  In the then we read about Alice and how she is diagnosed with leukemia. She gives Harvey very mixed signals because she likes him but she is also afraid to keep him close. Her prognosis isnt very good and its a confusing time for her. She decides to make a bucket list and this has consequences for the now where she finds out that the cancer is almost gone. When you expect your future to be over soon how do you deal with the fact that you are going to life after all Its an interesting thing to think about and I like how Murphy handled it.  I could understand Alice to a certain extent. Her confusions the way she deals with the uncertainties and how she tries to stay strong. Ive never been confronted with leukemia but I felt it was a realistic way to describe someones feelings and the stages of emotions they go through. But Alice wasnt a likable character at the same time. She acts like a complete bitch she uses Harvey when it comes in handy and I just didnt like her overall personality. To say it bluntly I could understand cancerAlice but I could never be friends with AliceAlice  if that makes sense.  You are hollow on the inside Alice did you know that Rotten too. And no one cares. No one cares because you make it so difficult to. I should tell you to go on being rotten on the inside but I cant because Harvey is so invested in you. Heres the sad truth Harvey cares for you. He more than cares for you and he still would even if you were as ugly on the outside as you are on the inside. Harvey the on you string along mercilessly. Not some slob who wants you as arm candy but Harvey. He loves you and for whatever reason this transcendental devotion he has for you defies the law of science and love.  Quote courtesy to my favorite character in the book Debora.  Harvey was a dumb ass. His admiration and unconditional love for Alice was so hard to understand. He openly admits that he knows that Alice uses him yet he continues to let her do it. I wanted him to stand up for himself and to grow a spine. I know that love sometimes works this way but I never felt the chemistry or even feelings from Alice towards Harvey. For me they were good friends with Alice being the one to profit from that friendship.  It was not a bad book but like I said I will not buy it reread it or highly recommend it. It might be because Im not such a contemporary reader but I missed having feelings (besides being annoyed.);Julie   Murphy

Arent MG and fairytale covers the best I always love the drawings and the details. Luckily this book isnt only pretty on the outside. Its a great book for young children and older people because its about friendship and finding yourself.  And thats its own kind of magic  to feel that people who are gone are still here.  Rump instantly stole my heart. Being bullied because of his halfname he feels lonely and weird. He is constantly looking for his destiny and he feels incomplete. His mother died before she could tell his name and therefore his name is Rump. He has a wonderful grandmother who adores him and he has a best friend called Red. This girl is feisty She isnt afraid to punch Rumps bullies in the face and people are afraid of her temper. Their friendship is heart warming.  Everyone works in the mines. The more gold you find the more food you get because they live under the rules of a greedy king. The miller distributes the food and he is a harsh and sneaky man. When Rump finds out about his talent the miller practically blackmails him to spin straw into gold for him. The king gets his hand on this gold and wants to know who did this the miller points out his daughter Opal. Rump is already in trouble and he the curse becomes worse when he tries to help this foolish girl.  With pixies trolls poison apples and witches this book is filled with great characters who play a role in Rumps true destiny finding his name and himself. I liked the moral of this story and I think its a fun twist on the real Rumpelstiltskin. The quick writingstyle makes this book enjoyable for every age.  They say that a minute is a minute no matter where you are or what youre doing but my brain could never grasp that. I think time is a trickster. When I have a lot to do time shrinks but when I want something over with it stretches and yawns and laughs at my torture. Sometimes the minutes hold hours inside of them.;Liesl Shurtliff

This story shows us the life of Margaret Tudor daughter of King Henry VII and Queen Elizabeth of York. She is the sister of Prince Arthur of Wales Henry VIII and Mary. The story starts when she is a little girl of 10 years. She is an intelligent perky girl and she knows that she is destined to become queen. Her father chooses King James IV (also Jamie) from Scotland. They show a lot of affection for each other and he is a kind husband.  When Margarets father dies Henry VIII becomes King and he marries Catherine of Aragon wife from the last king Arthur. We all know how his story continues but he plays a big role in Margarets life. Their countries are becoming enemies and Jamie dies in a battle in England. She is broken after his death but her love for their son James V (heir) and Alexander keeps her alive. She is 23 now. Her life only becomes more complicated. She remarries two times. Both marriages start happy but they dont end that well. Her first husband is even a treat to her son James V. It is a hard battle to get him on his rightful throne but she succeeds and when he marries to a good French woman she can finally rest from the hard life at Court.  I loved Margarets voice in the beginning. She is a funny girl and she knows exactly what she wants. Woman were used as strategic pieces but she is ready for it and her first marriage isnt that bad. Jamie was a good person despite his strange flaws. After her marriage to Angus the story starts to drag a little bit and its sometimes hard to follow how much times passes. We used to get an indication about her age but that is lost in the battle for her children. There is also a change in her voice. She is egoistic and a bit childish. I can understand that her son James V loses his temper around her. Despite that I really liked this book. It was interesting to read more about her. I knew that they changed the storyline in the television show The Tudors so it was nice to see a more realistic approach. Fascinating story of a woman with a lot of tragic losses and wrong choices in life.  Excerpt.  Things would be different had Eva not led Adam into sin he explained bowing his head to conceal his flushing face.  So Adam did not have a mind of his own I cried. If he was witless enough of yield to Eves temptation then it is his stupidity that warrants the curse  Madam you tread on blasphemy  Oh you dont want to hear it I lamented. You are on his side.

The middle part was good but not spectacular thats why I give it 4 stars. The beginning and ending would get 5 since they were very emotional and relatable for me.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Sometimes people think they know you. They know a few facts about you and they piece you together in a way that makes sense to them. And if you dont know yourself very well you might even believe that they are right. But the truth is that isnt you. That isnt you at all.  I dont read many contemporaries. There are several reasons for that but after seeing many positive reviews I was too curious. This also happened with John Green  The fault in our stars and since that book was a huge success for me I decided to give this one a shot. Its fun to branch out every now and then and I am so happy I did it. This story touched me on an emotional and personal level. I must admit that it was a bit.. tough sometimes but I love the message this book contains.  Im sorry that there is such a personal touch in this review. I dont want it to be all about me but this had to be said.  You think its so easy to change yourself. You think its so easy but its not. What do you think it takes to reinvent yourself as an allnew person a person who makes sense who belongs They will still see past that see you the girl who is still too scared still too smart for her own good still a beat behind still always wrong. Change all you want you cant change that. I know because I tried.  Elise is an outsider. A lonely girl who struggles with her identity because all she wants is to belong somewhere. To be someone. She even tries to change herself her clothing and her interests but nothing works. People pick on her and after a cry for help she is even more shunned than before. That is until she meets Pippa and Vicky on a midnight stroll. They introduce her to the party world of Start where she soon has the opportunity to DJ together with Char. Elise finally has a feeling she fits she has found her place in life.  I didnt need to be the most exciting beautiful beloved girl in the world. I just needed not to be me anymore.  I had a very strong feeling at the beginning of this book. The whole situation of being lonely and trying to change yourself comes close to a period in my life where I wasnt in a happy place in school. I was a shy insecure child while growing up I didnt have many friends and people were so unkind about the way I looked. I know exactly how Elise felt. The fact that she starts to feel happy and comfortable with herself by music is something I can identify with I had the same things with reading. I sometimes still feel like I dont really belong in the blogging world especially when I see how close some people are on (lets say) Twitter but I feel like Im growing like Elise. Im starting to put myself out there like her and its starting to pay off  There were also a couple of things she does that are unfamiliar for me but it wasnt hard to understand her behaviour. I must admit that it made the middle part a little less interesting but it was still good and strong. It was fun to read Elises voice because she is so smart strong and sweet. It was also fantastic to see how she develops into someone who is proud of herself  and that too reminded me of myself. You can see Elise is a very relatable character I think everyone can connect with.  The ending is again a part where this book shined. The message in this book is something we need to see more. It touched me and gave me the feeling that yes I need to be proud of myself and yes I need to stop feeling insecure. This book is definitely a feelgood story at the end and I highly recommend to read it.  You think its so easy to change yourself. You think its so easy but its not. True things dont stay the same forever. And with each of these moments you change and change again your true self spinning shifting positions  but always at last is returns to you. Because throughout it all you are still always you beautiful and bruised known and unknowable. And isnt that  just you enough;Leila Sales

Review coming soon.  edit also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  I havent read a fantasy book in a while and A cast of stones definitely reminded me of my love for adult fantasy. I was surprised when I saw that its a Christian fiction book according to Goodreads. There is a special system when it comes to the Church but the influence of Christendom never bothered me. The book did started a bit slow but the pleasant writingstyle was good enough to grab my attention.  This story follows Errol Stone an alcoholic who is willing to do anything for some money. When he volunteers to deliver a message to the priest Martin and Luis he is up to the adventure of a life time. He is hunted by deadly assassins and Errol is forced to flee together with them. When Luis finds out that Errol has the gift of sight he binds the boy to the Church. Readers are special because they can casts lots. These wooden objects can help the reader to make a decision in great matters. Errol almost dies when he is separated from the group. A family takes care of him and he finds out that he is good in fighting with the staff. When its time to leave Errol decides to join a caravan to work as guard. This will takes him to Erinon head of the city where he must fulfill his task.  Erinon is the place where the Church is established. Readers are being killed by an unknown enemy and the King is dying. It is time to cast in order to name the new King but there is someone out there who is trying to sabotage the outcome. It is up to Errol and some other characters to put the rightful king on the thrown before the barrier falls their only protection against their dangerous enemies.  First of all I really liked Errol. He is a mess in the beginning of the story but his development is incredible. We get to learn the reason behind his drinking problem and the way he slowly deals with it. He is a very likable character and I respected him. There are a lot of other side characters like Martin and Luis and I had the idea they all played a role in this story. The worldbuilding is good. The information is revealed piece by piece and that made me anxious to keep reading. Errol doesnt know a thing about readers picking a new King and politics so it was fun to learn everything through his eyes. The twist at the ending surprised me and I liked the slight wrapup. Im intrigued to read part two The heros lot.  If you are looking for some good old fantasy this is the book you want to pick up;Patrick W. Carr

Thats it. The story is great the characters are lovely and there is nothing wrong with the writing style. If I was a couple of years younger I would have loved it.  The story starts in Tir Na Nog and we get to meet a little girl and her brother at Oghams a special tree. She ran away from a party but there is someone else Fear Darrig and he tells her something frightening. The reign of King Finvarra will come to a very bad end at the hand of the marked child.  We skip a lot of time and we get to meet this girl Aine again. Now she is sixteen years old and she lives with her blind brother Spenser and her grandmother Glori. She has a companion called Mondegreen. It appears to be a hard woman although she is good for the children. She took them in after their mother left them  only Aine doesnt believe her. She wants to search for her mother once she is old enough. For now she just like to play in the woods with her brother. He is blind but that doesnt withhold him from swimming in the pool. When they hear someone scream Spenser dives into the water and saves a drowning boy called Tru. They are friends right away.  Strange things are going to happen. There comes a message that says that Biblos has arrived and Mondegreen introduces them to a boy named Gilgamesh. He owns a Toadhouse. Now everything happens really fast. They must leave with Gilgamesh to get three keys so they can return to their original book. Their mother is there waiting for them. Biblosh is a monster and he also wants to get those keys but they must stop him. He destroys every story he enters. Their world is actually a book and with the Toadhouse they can travel to other stories.  When what you find is true the next object will be revealed to you. There are three and they will bring you to your true family.  The first clue.  From that moment we get to enter different stories with these characters. Gilgamesh is their protector and Tru must return soon otherwise his story will end and thats not a good thing. Biblos is after them so they must hurry up. Where is the first object and can they find all the keys before Biblos catches them  Opinion.  Aine doesnt have any friends and she is teased at school about everything from the scars on her hands to her to green eyes. I dont understand She is funny smart and sweet. She is very protective and I love the relationship between her and her brother. Spenser is awesome. He is easy to be around with and brave.  I really liked the idea of this book. Living inside a tale and being able to travel to your favorite stories. The background story  why Biblos is after them and why there mother is in another book  is perfectly performed. Its just like I said I felt like I was a bit too old.;Jess Lourey

Its a place between our world (called Mundanus) and the world of the Fae (Exilium). One of the big cities is Aqua Sulis and all the important and Faetouched families live here. This book tells the story of several characters.  First we get to know Sam a Mundane. He is in the wrong place at the wrong time and that makes him a valuable eyewitness. He has no idea what is going on when he is questioned by Max and a sorcerer. Max is an Arbiter and he is assigned with the investigation of the disappeared Master of Ceremonies. When he and the sorcerer discover that Sams memory is locked by a powerful Charm he must find someone who can help them.Thats when Catherines also Cathy story comes in the picture.  Cathy ran away from her powerful family in Aqua Sulis. She lives in Mundanus protected by a spell to keep her family from finding her. When Lord Poppy (a high Fae lord) takes a certain interest in her her time in Mundanus is over. She is taken back to her parents and they already made plans for her future she is going to marry William second son from another rich family.  I like how these different stories come together but I wished they connected sooner. I was waiting for the moment but it felt a bit rushed when it finally happened. From all the people in the book I found Cathys POV the best. Her story is sad. She is desperate to live in our world far away from her fathers terror. I love how she never gave up and she stays true to herself. What I also appreciated was the fact that she was described as plain looking. Finally something else than flowing shining hair and dazzling eyes.  I liked the original Arbiter. This is someone whose soul is dislocated from his body. The downside was the disconnecting I felt with Max he has no emotions. He felt a bit flat.  The story was sometimes hard to follow. There are a lot of names and they all sound similar. I was a bit lost at some parts and when we got a glimpse of explanation it was nearly at the end. There were some things lacking in the worldbuilding. The plot was okay. There isnt much mystery but the story had a nice pace. The thing that really bothered me was the abrupt ending. It came out of nowhere and I felt like I missed something.  Not a bad book but its nothing special. (I have to mention it the cover is so pretty)  He clasped her hand again this time pressing it over his heart but she felt no beat through the silk shirt. Now I understand what a delicious creature of passion you are. It was buried so far beneath an inconsequential face and forgettable body that I almost missed it;Emma Newman

The first chapters left me annoyed by our Sleeping Beauty. Shes kissd by Bren and awakes after more than 80 years in stasis. Its a special sort of sleep where youre body and mind freeze in time. She had a really bad attitude. She was too dumb to understand anything so she wouldnt learn for school and stuff like that. She was immediately obsessed with Bren but she doesnt even know him.  But than the whole story gets another dimension and I began to understand her behaviour and way of thinking. Her parents were terrible parents. They sort of abused her mentally by putting her in statis everything they wanted. Vacation Work Annoyed Just put her into sleep until you feel like waking her up..  It really messed up her life and the beautiful love she had with Xavier (although this relation is kinda creepy.) I felt heartbroken at the end of the story. I just felt like crying for everything this girl lost in het life.. She got a lot back (like the friendship with Onno an humanrobot who can talk by touching someone. And he can see someones mind) but still.. I could only think about everything she could have before if her parents were just normal.  And because they wanted to assure that shed never life without them theyve putted an assassinator on her name. If shed wake up he would start with his mission. He must find her and bring her back and if that wouldnt be possible (her parents died so the robot cant take her to them) he must kill her. I mean what kind of person are you when you do something like that  And I love the writing. I really bonded with her in the end. Pff still feeling sad.;Anna Sheehan

Review is coming soon but in short  Kagawa loved it  Aguire almost a DNF.  Duvall started promising ended up boring.  Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  To be very honest the reason why I wanted to read this book was because of Dawn of Eden. I cant wait for The eternity cure after falling in love with The immortal rules. I loved this one. We get more information about the Red Lung virus. Kylie is trying to help her patients but they are all slowly dying. When Ben arrives with his wounded friend he is keeping a secret that will change their world very soon. It was a great way to understand the situation at the beginning of the outbreak. We even get a glimpse of a character in The immortal rules This story gets 4 out of 5 flowers.  The next novel wasnt my cup of tea. Thistle  Thorne by Ann Aguirre was a very confusing story. The worldbuilding wasnt fantastic and I didnt connect with Thorne or Mari. It started okay but the middle part was boring and I skimmed the last part. That isnt a good sign with such a short story. I rate this 1 out of 5 flowers because it was close to a DNF.  Sun Storm by Karen Duvall started very interesting. The world is plagued by sun storms with lethal rain of radioactive sun sparks which changes your DNA. Only Kinetics can survive the touch of the sparks and they have a special gift. Sarah can predict the upcoming storms and Ian new in town can control the weather. They dont know the important role they are going to play in the existence of the world. After this nice promise the story goes downhill. There is some travel there comes a bad guy more travel and I skimmed through the end. I rate this 2 out of 5 flowers because of the original subject.  This is the problem I always have with anthologies. Some stories are really good others suck. Im not sure if I recommend this book and that is a shame because Dawn of Eden is worth a read.;Julie Kagawa Ann Aguirre Karen Duvall

Kendra has nothing to do with this book and it doesnt have any connection with Beastly and Bewitching. Strange.. And it was good but was it as good as I expected Not really.  EDIT comment from the author  Thanks for the review. I apologize for any confusion about Kendra. This book is a standalone book and was never meant to be part of any series. In truth even Bewitching is a standalone book in that you dont have to read Beastly to read it (The Kendra Chronicles was meant to be a SUBTITLE not a series title). Apparently someone not associated with my publisher posted on Goodreads that Towering was about Kendra. If you look at the book or the ebook you can see that its not. Perils of the information age. Sorry.  The story is told from two POVs a boy and a girl. Rachel is locked away in a tower somewhere in the woods. Her new mother is protecting her after the murder on her biological mother. She feels trapped and she longs for company. That is where Wyatt comes in the picture. After a horrible happening he is ready to start again. His mother sends him to an old family friend Mrs Greenwood. The old woman has been alone after the disappearance of her daughter Danielle. Wyatt starts to hear a voice and when he follows his instincts he stumbles on Rachels tower. The two fall in love together from the moment they see each other. Wyatt discovers that Rachel and the strange disappearances of teenagers are somehow linked and he is determined to find out what is going on.  The things I liked  The dual POV. Rachel and Wyatt were both solid characters. Wyatt is plagued by guilt and Rachel is innocent and lonely. I can see why they were attracted to each other. I didnt feel connected to them but they were enjoyable enough to follow. Rachel has some kick ass moments and I appreciated her bravery.  The mystery. This was fun I liked to fit the pieces together together with Wyatt. Some things were predictable some things managed to surprise me. The aspects of the modern setting were subtle because they never spoiled the fairytale feeling. The somewhat dark conclusion was welldone and I liked the ending.  The thing I didnt liked  The romance. Oh boy Flinn screwed this up. There was enough time to develop their feelings but there had to be a worse case instantlove.. From the moment they see each other they feel connected like there whole purpose on this planet is to be together. I didnt buy is even when Flinn tried to explain it by throwing in a lame reason. It all started so good with Rachel saving Wyatts life but it went downhill and it became incredibly cheesy. The I love yous and meant to be together are frequently used.  Conclusion  A fun twist on a popular story but it could have been better. I did enjoy myself and it was fun to figure out the mystery;Alex Flinn

Heather Jane Bell is fifteen years and suffers from Alopecia. This means that her hair will fall out because her immune system attacks the hair follicles. She has been friends with Simon for 10 years now. He is a popular typical pretty boy and she is bullied because nobody understands her friendship she is too normal for him. An awkward kiss ends their friendship and Simon ignores her. Heather is devastated and when she loses clumps of hair on school she doesnt want to attend school anymore.  Her parents send her to a greataunt called Elspeth in West Yorkshire. When Heather takes a walk she is surrounded by a mist and swept away back in time. She ends up with Emily Jane Bronte and her family father Charlotte Anne Branwell (his real name is actually Patrick) Tabby (the maid) and aunt Branwell. Heather doesnt know it yet and she suspects that she just lost her way during the walk. She can live with them until father Bronte finds her aunt.  Times passes and Heather finds her way in the family. She is now aware that the mist transported her back in time but she is far too busy to think about her real home all the time she and Branwell are growing to like each other. He is a very troubled boy but he makes her feel beautiful. Will she ever return to her home And does she want that  I liked Heathers voice. I could understand her feelings I would be broken if I lose my long hair. I was happy that she wasnt whiny about it and she starts to realize that she can be beautiful despite her sickness. It wasnt hard to connect with her.  Aviva used another storyline to spice up the story and I liked that. It made sure that I was hooked to the pages and I was never bored. It was hard to put it down and her writingstyle was pleasant. The fact that every chapter starts with a piece of Emilys writing was great Very nice addition to the Bronte feeling. The worldbuilding is good. I could imagine all the places Heather visits and the secondary characters are welldone.  So I would definitely recommend this book if you like timetravel;Aviva Orr

Review coming soon.  Also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2....  Most Tudors books are a success for me but this one lacked of something. I missed the spark and I couldnt connect with the story or the characters. This could be my own fault because I didnt know this was the 5th part in a series when I requested it on Netgalley. I decided to read it anyway and its definitely a standalone but it might be the reason for my disconnection. This resulted in the fact that I wasnt sucked into the story. I was aware of the fact that I was reading a story instead of being part of it.  It was also far too long for my taste. It would have been much better with 100 pages less. There are a couple of characters and the story is split between their lives. The most important character is Justine who is the daughter of a dead traitor. She grew up with the Thornleigh family as one of them. When she and Will fall in love she is afraid to tell him the truth Will hates her true family with a fierce passion. Justine is used as a spy when Mary (Queen of Scotland) flees to England to find help. Justine naive as she is starts to trust her. She doesnt know that Mary conspires with Justines father to overthrow Elizabeth.  I wasnt only disconnected from the characters some of they annoyed me incredibly. Justine face palm She believes everyone without thinking. I wish she had more brains instead of blind faith in the goodness of people. Then there is Will who loves her but doesnt want to marry her because of her name he has a blind hate for her family. I see why but this girl is nothing like her father and she grew up in a different family. She is a Thornleigh no matter where she came from. Its just strange that people are so easy with their love.  This story is stretched over 400 pages and the writingstyle was just okay. The plot was good but the story wasnt interesting enough to capture my attention. I kept waiting for the climax and that is never a good sign. Overall just a meh story. There isnt much I can say about it.;Barbara Kyle

I was getting tired of disappointing books about two months ago so I thought it would be good to switch up genres. After seeing a positive review of this book on Debbys blog Snuggly Oranges I wanted to give it a try. Im very happy I did because it was exactly what I needed. Cute romances and a wonderful friendship it was all I could ask for.  Gigi Bea and Neerja became best friends when they were children and they are still together. They are the smart girls of the school always studying and trying to get the best results until they decide they want more. They want people to notice them in other ways. When Gigi and Mike get in trouble because of a test she decides to run for student rep to change the rules. Neerja is going for the theater and Bea picks up her old hobby of skiing.  I loved Gigis voice. She reminded me a bit of myself always overachieving and trying to be the best. She doesnt care much about popularity but there is still that feeling of wanting more. It was fun to see their different personalities and how they complement each other. They are supportive despite their different interests. Gigi is afraid of speaking in public (thats me too) but they still get her to run for student rep. Seeing her grow and open up was great and I felt proud of her.  Besides the friendship there are also two cute romances. There is a touch of lovetriangle but instead of being too much I understood the confusion. Will is the new boy and he is Gigis opponent. He is a true charmer and it wasnt strange that she had a crush on him. He is nothing compared to Mike though the boy she is supposed to dislike because he got her in troubles. He stole my heart right away and I enjoyed their banter. Mike was the perfect combination of smart and attractive. I liked how Gigis opinion about him changes throughout the story.  This book is the perfect combination of friendship romance and developing. I highly recommend this book if you are in the mood for something fluffy with an important lesson.;Sarah Strohmeyer

Its definitely going to end up in my favourite list of 2014.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Like you all might know by now Beauty and the beast is my favorite fairytale so I was excited and scared for this book at the same time. There was no need for this because it not only lived up to my expectations  it exceeded it. The first and most important thing I need to say is I personally LOVED this book but I dont think this will work for everyone. It was a magical journey through a complex and interesting mix of fairytales and mythology for me but I dont think everyone will feel that way.  I had a lot of trouble trying to write a coherent review to convey my love for this book and I hope it works.  The basic story is Nyx marriage to the Gentle Lord  prince of Demons  after a bargain her father made years ago. She grew up with the knowledge that she would need to sacrifice herself to save Arcadia. But when Nyx comes to live with the Gentle Lord who calls himself Ignifex she finds out that he is different. Not only that her plan to collapse his house isnt going to work. Its up to Nyx to find a new way but can she still kill the man she has fallen in love with  This book shines in different aspects. The first thing that hooked me was the writingstyle. Hodge has a beautiful prose that flows off the pages. I was enthralled by her descriptions and the world she created. The combination of Mythology and fairytales is spectacular and she created something unique. I really liked how she set up the plot and how everything slowly unravels.  Now on to the characters who were just perfect in their imperfect way. The thing with these characters is that they know they have bad sides and they still find a way to deal with it. Nyx has evil in her heart and she tries to deal with it. She bears hate and love towards her family and she struggles with that. This made the sisterdynamic very interesting and I love that they stick with each other no matter what. Nyx is also feisty and loyal. Her first encounter with her new husband ends up in a fight where she smashes her fist into his face. Their banters were highly amusing and I ship them. I ship them hard.  Ignifex is a perfect example of an antihero. He has these different sides we also see in the Beast from the original tale. He can be harsh and mean but on the inside is a charming man who is trapped in a life he created in desperation. In the beginning you only see him as the bad guy. He makes bargains with foolish people tricking them into a (most of the times) horrible fate but when you find out that he isnt evil because he wants to  that is the moment you are practically begging for them to find a way to free him.  Ignifex sat down. If you start wondering how this house works youll likely go mad. That could be amusing I suppose. Especially if its the kind of madness that causes you to run naked through the hallways. Do feel free to indulge in that anytime.  Nyx and Ignifex are meant for each other with their sizzling chemistry. You could call it instalove but it worked for me. It made sure that the story keeps its pace. There is also a slight hint of lovetriangle. Let me assure you it makes sense. The ending is just like I wanted it to be. There is justice and waiting  but it ends realistic and satisfying.  I look forward to more work from this author.;Rosamund Hodge

While this is definitely not the best book Ive ever read the low rating on Goodreads surprised me The first two reviews are 1star ratings.  This book is a quick paced story that is set in Australia. Ophelia  also called Phi  is an Olympic messenger. Her mother passed away a few years ago and her father is supposed to be Hermes. She has quite a family. Not everybody has Hades and Zeus as uncles. Her life is turned upside down when she meets demigod Aden son of Aphrodite and Adonis. She turns him down and as a revenge he sends her all of the world to deliver nonsense messages. Some even get her almost killed because we get to meet a huge variety of mythological creatures.  There is also Simeon a mysterious creature with a bad reputation in the world of Gods but he is protecting Phi. He keeps warning her but the search for her real father and her flirtations with Aden are keeping her far to busy. Unfortunately for her someone is after her and an orb she never heard of. When she learns new information about her mother her life is starting to get really complicated. To make things worse she is kidnapped by her real grandfather and she gets another task in this world. This happens over a large timespan and she suffers a lot. Despite that Phi kept fighting. She doesnt take shit from anyone and I found her very strong. I only wished that she took some things more seriously. She felt a bit immature sometimes but she is already in her mid twenties.  The other characters are fun. I really liked Hermes but Aden wasnt too bad either. We also have the arrogant and bitchy Gods especially Aphrodite. I thought that Hades rocked.  I must admit that the storyline gets a bit overwhelming sometimes. There is a LOT going on. The search for her real father the new identity of her mother complots from several Gods kidnapping and abuse flirting with Aden and her inner struggle do I surrender to my feelings or do I keep listening to my brains This all made sure that the story is never boring but it was also a bit chaotic. The plot is okay and the ending was happy and wrapped everything up like I expected.  Keep in mind that this story isnt YA. The writingstyle felt like it but there are some situations with quite some violence and sexual related content (nothing to heavy but still.);Peta Crake

The first time I heard about this book I was extremely excited to read it. But when the hype started it became one of those feared books. I am happy to announce that this book is worth the hype. I absolutely fell in love with the characters and the plot.  Aileana has been training with Kiaran to kill all types of faeries. Her mother died and Aileana is the only one who saw the real killer a fairy. She is now taking revenge and trying to find the one who killed her mother to avenge her death. But Aileana is now in danger because her true nature has been shown she is a Falconer.  The wonderful thing about this book is the cast. We have Aileana a feisty hunter who loves to tinker with mechanics to create effective weapons. I would like to stay on her good side because she knows how to fight. I admired her strength and how she deals with all the people who still talk behind her back rumours that she is the one who killed her mother. Now she is stuck with her loveless father who plans to marry her off. It could have been worse because Gavin stole my heart. It was clear from the beginning that they wont be a couple but I liked his presence a lot. He has a dry humor and his own gifts come in handy.  Kiaran picks up my drawing. Try it and Ill pluck your wings off and feed them to you. Derrick hisses. Gavin just looks interested as if wondering whether such a thing might be possible.  Well I say brightly were getting on splendidly arent we Glad to see youre all becoming friends over your mutually violent desires.  Not me Gavin says. Im just here for the tea.  I also loved Aileanas best friend and the dynamic they have. It was nice to have a normal friendship because sometimes friends seem to disappear in storylines. And there is Kiaran he is mysterious dark and a bit moody. I liked everything about him but I do hope to get to know more about him. He is always holding back and he never answers Aileanas questions.  The plot is a solid story. Aileana is hunting for faeries until they start to hunt her for her status as Falconer. It was interesting to hear the history about Falconers and how this changes her. She is constantly hungry for killing and the thrill of a fight. There is enough action to keep this book fastpaced. The ending is just mean. I was biting my nails and it made me very anxious for the sequel. Be prepared to have your heart shattered in the last couple of pages but youre going to love it.;Elizabeth May

Appendectomyscar good (as Evie would say) We had to wait a long time for the release of Lair of dreams but its just as good as The Diviners. Libba Bray managed to create story with a subtle creepiness that seeps into the story of a diverse cast. Libba knows how to write and how to handle different point of views. The book never gets overwhelming and she choose the right moments to showcast another character.  Evie talks on the radio because of her famous status as objectreader. She has no contact with Uncle Will and she is trying to avoid Jericho because she knows her friend Mabel fancies him. Instead Evie ends up in a fakeengagement with her enemy Sam. The two have hilarious banter and I remember shipping them in the first book so I was quite happy with this development. Sam has his own problems and he wants Evie to help him he wants to find out what happened to his mother and what the meaning is of Project Buffalo. It is a dangerous quest.  I loved Sam and how he is set on finding out the truth. I like it when characters are so loyal to the ones they care for. The only thing that bothered me is how Evie acted every now and then. She isnt the best friend for Mabel and it seems like her new status is too overwhelming which turns her into a different person.  Henry is still dreamwalking and on one night he meets Ling and WaeMei. Together with Ling he hopes to be able to find his boyfriend Louis whom he lost years ago after his father disapproval. Ling wants to save her best friend George who is trapped in the sleeping disease that is spreading across the city. People are locked into their dreams and they are no longer able to wakeup. Nobody can explain what is going on and we get glimpses of these terrifying nightmares. Ling was a fantastic new character. She is a really strong girl and I admired her willingness to help a stranger. The glimpses of Henry and Louis in the past were adorable.  We also see Memphis and his brother Isaiah. Memphis is slowly exploring his returning gift of healing. I was a bit scared of blind Bill who is portraying to be a caring nice person but is actually after more. This storyline is a bit smaller but I cant wait to explore more. I think they will play a bigger role in the next book.  The ending of this book is fabulous and incredibly mean at the same time. It makes you want to pick up the next one but then you realize you need to wait a long time before that is possible.

I just wanted to break something out of frustration because this book features one of those dreaded instaloves  and its really really bad. The other aspects of the book werent amazing either but I could deal with those until I reached the ending. The story just fell apart after the introduction from the romance and its just not okay to finish a book like that. The more I think about this book the more I start to hate it. I initially gave it 2 stars on Goodreads but after finishing my rant I have to give it 1 stars.  Violet  named after her purple eyes which is already ridiculous  grew up as surrogate. She has been training her special powers in order to create a perfect child in service of a royalty. Its her chance to shine in The Jewel the wealthy part of their world but Violet can only think about one thing freedom.  I thought it was an okay concept. The royalty cant have children so they found out another way to continue their bloodline. I still dont really know why they cant have their own children. It doesnt seem important to explain and I dont think it would make any sense anyway. How is it possible that from all the people in the world the royalty cant have children They dont know why only girls from the poorest circle have the strange genetic mutation that causes the Auguries. How convenient Thats also a way to avoid explanations. I better get more information in the next book.  Most surrogates come from the Mash the outer circle where Violet would have grown up in poverty. There are different sections with own roles in society. Lucien picks her clothes and makeup before she is sold. They all get to see their family one last time before they are swept away to The Jewel. The Hunger Games anyone But despite all the things I disliked about this book the descriptions about the luxurious parties and the overall idea arent so bad.  I felt indifferent to Violet. She never undergoes any change or development she just stays her bland self that is described as unique powerful extreme beautiful and the whole shebang yawn To me she was nothing too special and Im a bit tired of these too perfect girls that never truly show to me who they are its only told to me. The only thing I liked about her is how she is willing to sacrifice her life to keep her best friend Raven save. It shows that there is some strength in her but its all hidden away behind her naivety and her important role that is yet to be revealed.  But you Violet you have such a strong natural power that with one application youve already exceeded my expectations. Ive worked with many surrogates in my career and not a single one of them could accomplish what you have done.  And you know I kind of liked the beginning. The writingstyle is quick and easy but everything went downhill the moment we are introduced to the handsome Ash with no other traits than his good looks thats all we know about him before Violet desperately falls in love with him. He of course answers those feelings because she is nothing like any other girl she sees him for who he is he now realizes how lonely he was etc. You know how it goes. So after three meetings its quite clear they have to share their lives and should get babies together. Well fuck you because you cant.  Violet he says and when he looks in my eyes my stomach somersaults. I think.. I think I love you. I feel myself dissolve into a thousand molecules amazed at how three small words can completely alter my state of being.  I think I love you too I whisper.  Violet he says getting up and putting his hands on my arms as if to steady me. Am I shaking I guess I am. His fingers are warm against my skin. Are you all right Did something happen  II love you I stammer. Its especially creepy if you imagine this situation Ash is sleeping. She is standing there in the middle of the night. To tell him she loves him. I would be scared.  So much promise gone to waste because another author fell into the instalove crap we all hate. And the best part is when you reach the ending. The whole book is more a setup where pretty much nothing happens and when the plot FINALLY kicks in its in the last page where the story ends in the middle of the scene. Its like not finishing your  I truly wish this book lived up to its promise and cover but it was too good to be true. I still have a feeling Im going to read the sequel.

Words to describe this book Horrible. Disgusting. Terrible. Tagline A failed attempt for a Tarzan retelling.  You guys Im not even sure where I need to get started. This book made me roll my eyes grind my teeth and there were several times where I wanted to throw it out of the window. I only finished it because its a review copy and I put more effort in those. I feel so stupid because I could have saved myself an hour filled with frustration and stupid characters that made my eyes bleed.  To make a long boring story short. Cade has been living in the woods since he was little because his parents believed the world was ending. Dara and Josh are secretly camping in the woods to bring new life in their relationship. They lied to their parents and now Dara found out they are followed by someone. Anyone sane would freak out pack their backs and leave like Josh suggests. Instead Dara is fascinated and she forces Josh to stay.  What the hell Dara were leaving. Lets start getting this stuff together.  Dara surprised herself when she said No.  Wait what  No she repeated. Tugging the necklace away from him she tucked it in her pocket. Im not afraid. Im curious. I mean if he wanted to hurt us he could have slit our throats last night while we were sleeping.  I was glad that Josh turned out to have more sense. Dara keeps talking smack about him but she doesnt deserve him. She is constantly mad at him for trying to get back to safety but what the hell is wrong with you girl  And what kind of jerk would he be to abandon his girlfriend in the middle of nowhere. With some weird homeless guy already on her scent at that. Where was all her carefulatnight parkingunderthelights askingsecuritytowalkherout defensiveness now  At this point I was already very tired of Dara and nothing happens except for her whining but then they get into a bear attack and I was secretly hoping they would just die. That wasnt the case because Cade jumps in the middle and saves them while getting seriously injured. This is how he makes his big entrance in normal society. While he is in the hospital recovering Dara gets to spread some more of her stupidity with her dumbass friend of a Sofia.  A highpitched tone lingered on the line. It resolved into Sofia asking And  And what  Is he hot  With a sigh Dara dropped her hand in her lap. Seriously Sof. Im still traumatized for real. He was torn to shreds. I was literally holding pieces of his chest together. Immediately penitent Sofia apologized. Sorry. Sorry. My whole week has been is she hot Is he hot Whos hot Am I hot Brain is still engaged in Orlando Vision obviously. Is he okay  Our precious Dara also isnt aware of how terrible this situation is. Her parents found out she lied about her destination she was also attacked by a bear and returns with a wounded boy with no identity. Instead of being happy that she is still allowed to leave the house she is whining about how unfair life is.  Dara wasnt sure why her parents had cracked down so hard. She was a good student. She didnt get in trouble they never had to worry about hernot like they did about Lia. And whats more they knew she was spending spring break with Josh. Sure they thought it would be at Disney World not Daniel Boone National but so  Only finding these quotes and using them for this review makes me mad and annoyed again so I cant take it any longer. Its up to you to decide if you can stand her but good luck with that. Oh also just because Cade grew up in the forest doesnt make this a Tarzan retelling. That would be the same as a book where a girl is looking for a shoe that doesnt make her a Cinderella either.;Alex Mallory

This is what I call a solid book. Interesting topic an okay writingstyle and okay characters. I liked it but its nothing too special. Everything is a bit too okay but I give the author credits for the original twist. Ive never read a book like this about The Tudors. What if Anne Boleyn gave life to a boy What if that boy grew up to be king after his fathers dead Those are the questions we get answered in this story.  Henry IX seventeen years old son of the deceased Henry VIII is waiting to prove himself. He is known as William and he trusts three people in his life Dominic the orphan Minuette who was raised by Anne Boleyn and his older sister Elizabeth. There is an interesting friendship between these people and I was happy to see that there was some loyalty. One day Minuette discovers that a friend got herself involved in a dangerous complot. The girl dies in an accident and Williams sends Minuette as spy to several households. Someone wants to take the thrown and they are trying to spread rumors about his birth they want to brand him as bastard.  The complot was good and is partly solved at the end. I liked that there is a conclusion with enough open endings for the second book.The characters were okay but I felt a distant. I wasnt connect to any of them. Minuette is a brave girl. She dares to speak her mind to the king but she was a bit too naive for me. William sounds like someone who could be a great king. Hes sometimes a bit too much like his father (when it comes to women). He is young and impulsive but I think he needs time to adapt to his power. Dominic is difficult to read and Elizabeth isnt enough in the book to develop.  I was looking forward to see Annes role in this book but she is hardly there. The lovetriangle at the end felt forced and out of place. Overall interesting take on The Tudors but I wasnt blown away. Im not going to read the next book soon perhaps not at all.;Laura Andersen

This book is steamy Im not kidding. The chemistry sparks right from the pages and we get some sexy times that made me swoon. How often do you hear me say that Let me tell you I hardly say it but only master Sarah can make me feel that. Its also not hard when you keep imagining Richard Armitage as Tamlin (and other hot actors I picked for my movie cast).  This story is mindblowing. I love what Sarah did with the original Beauty and the beast story and I dare to say she made it even better. The combination with the faeries works so well and I loved the explanation behind the curse that plagues the faeries and how it could be broken by performing three hard tasks. Those different fairytale elements made the plot complex and creative.  The characters were great but what else did you expect Feyre is a character on her own. I sometimes feel authors reuse characters from previous series but thats not the case here. Feyre definitely resembles Celaena in some traits but she is herself. Her loyalty to her family is admirable. Her father is crippled and cant work for money so Feyre is the one who has to take care for him and her two sisters. She does a great job but it also means she cant live for herself. That changes when she is dragged to Tamlins house to spend her life there paying for the mistake she made. Instead of whining and crying Feyre decides she must do everything in her power to escape. She takes her vow to her family very serious and she cant let them down. What I like about Feyre is that she is kickass in the moments that need strength but she also has a vulnerable side. This made her realistic and an easy character to feel connected with.  Tamlin Lucian and Rhsyand are the main fey in this book. Tamlin is exactly how I remember the beast. He can be rough but he is trying and there is a complexity to his character that I cant explain without spoilers so you have to see it for yourself. His chemistry with Feyre blew me away and it sizzled from the pages. Lucian is the sarcastic sidekick who made me laugh out loud. He reminded me a little of Sturmhond and Thorne  and there is Rhysand. He is the type of character you are supposed to hate but you cant. He has the same complexity as Tamlin and I cant wait to see more of him in the sequel.  This book is also beautiful. The prose and the worldbuilding with all its details it made me feel like I was walking right there and no matter how brutal it could be I WANTED to be there. The creepy faeries arent enough to scare me away and Tamlins Spring Court sounds lovely and warm.  So what Im trying to say is read this book. NOW. It is amazing.  Edit  Pure perfection. Its all I imagined it would be and more. It has ever everything I could wish for. Review will follow. Or better a raving fangirl attempt to write something that makes sense.

I like the Disney movie version and I absolutely love the retelling from Jodi Lynn Anderson called Tiger Lily. So it was about time to read this one This is one of the classics I had on my list for this year.  I think everybody knows the story of the famous Peter Pan. I always liked the part where he loses his shadow  and how he is trying to stick it back to his body. This is his first meeting with Wendy. He takes the Darling children to his country Neverland where he lives with his lost boys. Peter Pan is doomed to live forever (he doesnt agree with me though. Peter doesnt want to grow up) Wendy soon becomes their mother and the three children are slowly starting to forget about their own parents. They have a lot of adventures of course with Captain Hook. He hates Peter after the boy took his hand and he is always on the run for the ticking crocodile.  I actually didnt like Peter. He was a strange character. Always boosting about things that never happened or he completely forgets about his new adventures. He can be very unkind. The ending surprised me and I feel sad for him I dont think he has any idea what he is actually missing.. Wendy was nice (although I hated her in Tiger Lily) and I like how she is acting as a mother. The lost boys were fun and I love Hook. Its funny how jealous Tinkerbell is and she has a quite nasty temper. I completely forgot about her mean nature because she has such a sweet spirit in her own Disney movies.  T  his book was definitely one I had to read but I dont think Im going to reread it. It was just okay and interesting for one time.;J.M. Barrie

This book failed to impress me. Whether it were my high expectations the hype surrounding it or just this story I had a hard time reading it. Its a shame that I wasnt able to connect with the characters because I still think its an unique setting and promise. I like the story that is created but the plot could have used some interesting twists.  Im first going to start with the things I liked. The worldbuilding is pretty good and Rick knows how to paint a good picture of a destroyed world. Cassie is lonely and she believes she might be one of the last survivors after the first four disastrous waves. I like the explanations behind the Silencers and how they were able to infiltrate our daily lives without any effort. Those aliens are smart cookies.  But this is where it stops. The thing I disliked the most was my disconnection with any of the characters. Cassie showed some infuriating behavior at the start of the book and that prevented me from bonding with her. She definitely developed and she has some good qualities but I couldnt overlook her earlier stupidity.  She just got shot in her leg and this boy Evan saved her from dying. The first thing she thinks about is  Im worried my hair might smell. I want some chocolate... What did he think about my body What did I think about my body  Like thats the most important part to think about. Perhaps you should worry for the fact that this guy is a stranger and your world is under attack by aliens who might look like humans Not to mention the fact that she has some strange anger issues. This boy did save her in the end and he takes care of her but the only thing she can do is acting like a bitch.  Did I ask you go to get me anything I want to pop him right in that perfectly shaped mouth. Why do I want to hit him Why am I so mad right now  The worst thing is that she throws food at him without ANY reason. She is mad that he is giving her the silent treatment after her whiny bitch fit and then she has the nerves to attack him with food because he says that he doesnt want her to die. Yes how dare he  Evan.. He is practically drooling over her and not very late in the story he is kissing her and telling her he loves her. She is acting like a spoiled brat and there is zero chemistry between them so I could have done without this romance. He is also the perfect example of a dominant man because he truly believes that she needs him. HE is the only reason she could possibly survive the search for her brother. Imagine that the girl might be capable of doing it herself. Cassie has survived on her own so far I think its legit to say that she is able to do it herself.  What also bothered me was the constant switch between POVs and even writingstyle. It was very confusing and often I found myself lost whose chapter is this It shows that there is hardly any difference in voice between the characters. Its a pity because I was excited for this book and Ive seen many positive reviews. Ill not be reading more books in this series.;Rick Yancey

This book wasnt as good as I wanted it to be but I must say that my expectations were ridiculously high. Being a fairytale lover and fan of Beauty and the beast that was inevitable. There were many things I enjoyed and in the end I do recommend this book but I was a bit let down by the characters.  I loved the worldbuilding. The story starts with a story of how the world was created. It was an interesting explanation on how the difference between the Smooth skins in the domes and the Monstrous in the desert began. The incorporation of the roses was welldone and creative especially when everything is cleared up at the end of the story. I think it could have been even more explored but there was enough information to make it understandable.  On to the characters. Isra a blind smooth skin princess grew up without her mother and a clear destiny she would be sacrificed one day to protect the city. The roses are hungry for Queens blood and to keep them satisfied a Queen must bleed and sacrifice her life. Nobody ever questioned this and Isra will follow the rules too. Its hard for her when her father dies in an attack and she is soon swept away in a battle for power. She is the Queen but nobody is going to listen to a young blind princess with signs of mutation. That is until she meets Gem one of the beasts who is captured during the attack. He promises to help her to stop the mutation by growing a special plant and the two start an unusual friendship.  I had trouble to connect with both character despite the fact that they both have their own POV. Isra is naive and insecure. I know how that feels but it got on my nerve. She keeps whining about how ugly appearance and how nobody wants to listen to her. Newsflash do something about it Feeling sorry for yourself isnt going to change anything. I did like her character development and how she slowly starts to grow into her role as Queen. Gem confused me. His inner battles were sometimes a bit too much and they repeated the same over and over again.  This made the middle part a bit too draggy for my taste but the full potential of this book lies in the last part. I liked it when every bit of information came together and how true love conquers everything because the romance was adorable. Isra and Gem change each other in a good way. I was rooting for them and it was fun to see how two people  who are supposed to hate each other  struggled with their feelings. There is time enough to develop to make this realistic and cute.  If you are looking for an unique use of the fairytale with a fun dystopian twist this is something you might want to try.  Beauty is wherever you find it and Beast is there when you need to defend it.;Stacey Jay

I have mixed feelings about this anthology. Im not a huge fan of them but I couldnt pass this one when I saw it was inspired by classic fairy tales. The dark and sinister twist made it sound even better but I was let down by many stories and by most of them Im still looking for that promise. I found them boring and uninteresting instead of darktwisted.  My favorite stories were  Jon Skrovan  The raven girl inspired by The raven. This had a very fairytaleish feeling something I missed in some of the other short stories. I do have a feeling that its basically the same story as the original but I havent read the it  yet. I hope to compare them soon. Its about a princess who is turned into a raven after an accidental wish of her mother. They are now both looking for the boy to turn her back into a human girl. Julie Kagawa  The brothers Piggett based on Three little piglets. I love everything she writes. She knows how to create a gripping story and I like that its only loose based on the original story. She created something of her own. Kimberly Derting  Light it up inspired by Hansel  Gretel. I like how she used the modern world without losing the magical feeling. She blended them well together by switching a witch into a cannibalistic hunter. Claudia Gray  A real boy based on Pinocchio. Very fun scifi twist that reminds me of Cinder and last Jackson Pearce because she turns one of my least favorite princesses into something good (Snow white).  Train wrecks  Ellen Hopkins  Before the rose bloomed The snow queen. This is very personal but I dont like this style.  Chopping lines and  random enters  doesnt make it  poetry.  I did read the entire story because I love retellings of it and it wasnt bad. This way of writing just doesnt seem to work for me and Im glad I figured that out before trying one of her books. Sarah Rees Brennan  Beauty  The Chad Beauty and the beast. This was HORRIBLE. Ugh. She completely butchered my favorite tale. The whole modernisation was ridiculous and out of place. The beast talks about dudes and whats up bro Just.. no. You dont go there with fairy tales  The other stories were okay. Not memorable but definitely not bad. There is a retelling of Bluebeard and I liked the subtle use. There was another Beauty and the beast retelling and I loved the concept but it could use a longer storyline. I had a feeling some of them werent done yet. All together it was a fun book to read once but I wont purchase or reread it.;Christine   Johnson Kimberly Derting Sonia Gensler Tessa Gratton Claudia Gray Rachel Hawkins Amanda Hocking Ellen Hopkins Shaun David Hutchinson Julie Kagawa Malinda Lo Myra McEntire Saundra Mitchell Jackson Pearce Sarah Rees Brennan Jeri SmithReady Jon Skovron

(check it out to see Maria Snyder answer the question who she would cast for the movie)  It takes place six year after the end of Fire Study the third book in the Study series. Technically this is the fourth book in the series but they decided to call it a spinoff with a new title called Soulfinders. It was amazing to return to this world and the characters Ive grown to love. The story was also written in such a way that it wasnt too hard to recall what happened in the previous books quite an achievement  I was invited for the blog tour band I was more than happy to be part of this because its a very solid fantasy series that I highly recommend. This review is spoiler free for the entire series.  The main events in the Study series are about Yelena who gets a choice get hanged for her crimes or start a new life as food taster. She learns the art of recognizing poison under the watchful eyes of Valek spy and assassin from the Commander ruler of Ixia. This is the start of a thrilling journey where Yelena and Valek start to bond together.  Six years later Yelena is officially still an enemy of Ixia but she works together with Valek to keep the unstable peace between Sitia and Ixia. When the two think they can share a quiet weekend together an assassin spoils their time by shooting a poisoned arrow at Yelena. Valek is trying to discover how the black market still manages to smuggle goods between Ixia and Sitia.  This book is told from the POV of Yelena Valek and partly Janco (one of the trusted members of Valeks team) This had a positive and negative side. I truly loved how we were able to see the story from different sides. Yelena is looking for answers around her magicproblem Valek is frustrated and suspects there is something strange going on with the Commander  Janco is working together with Ari and new member Onora to discover the smuggler roads.  Valeks POV gave us more information about his past and how he became the man he is today which was fantastic The combination of these perspectives gave an interesting fastpaced plot with multiple angles but sometimes it felt a bit too jumpy. It could be hard to let go of a storyline.  The only thing I wasnt charmed with was Yelenas rash decisions. This is something I complained about in my previous reviews and unfortunately she hasnt changed one bit. She throws herself into dangerous situations without second thoughts and she keeps secrets to herself which creates more chaos. I know she could be smarter so its frustrating how she acts like she is untouchable  especially in the vulnerable state shes in. Valek stayed his calm calculated personality Ive grown to respect. I like how he keeps a cool mind and his quick thinking comes in handy. I am fascinated by the addition of Onora and I cant wait to find out more about her.  The plot was nicely created and offers enough suspension and questions to keep you busy. There were some unexpected twists and turns that caught me off guard which is always a plus point for me. Combine this with an easy writingstyle and you got yourself a very enjoyable book. This book was more than I could have wished for. I was a bit scared that the author wouldnt be able to create the same feeling but she did. And now its time again to wait for the new installments;Maria V. Snyder

This book messed with my mind. The compelling writingstyle and jumping between storylines hooked me it made me curious to find out what truly happened that night Sophies life completely changed. Suddenly she lost her best friend and was forced to go in rehab for an addiction she no longer suffered from. Sophie is done with all the accusations and decided to go and find the truth herself why was Mina killed  Going back and forth between different time periods can be a tricky thing but Tess nailed it in this story. We get to see Sophie before during and after the murder of Mina and it was an intricate way to puzzle the pieces together.  Before Sophie is addicted to painkillers after an accident that leaves her with a limp. We see her struggle with her injury and the pain. During Sophie is on her way with Mina to talk with someone who helps Mina with her journalism story. After Sophie is still alive and Mina is dead. The whole scene was setup as a drugs deal gone bad and Sophies parents dont believe her story. Her mother brings her to rehab and when she is released we see her mission to bring out the truth.  During this story we find out what secret is between Sophie and Mina and how she deals with her feelings for Mina and Minas brother Trev. The conclusion was satisfying but also came a little out of nowhere. The book did leave you questioning who was behind the murder but as far as I can recall there were hardly any clues. This made the culprit a bit vague and not stand out as a character.  Credits to the author for the healthy portrayal of Sophies parents. We see a family that is torn apart after Sophies addiction and how her parents try to make the best out of it. It is clear they love her and believe they make the right choices for her. It shows that parents can make mistakes too even if they do it out of love.  [image error]  We walk into the rest of our lives together not knowing itll end before its truly started.;Tess Sharpe

Her moral nihilism and thus her murders are a way of lifethe only way of life she has ever known.But when a letter appears in the mailbox that will have the power to topple Kits convictions as perfectly as she commits her murders she must make a decision follow the only rules she has ever known or challenge Rule One and go from there.Katherine Ewells Dear Killer is a sinister psychological thriller that explores the thin line between good and evil and the messiness of that inevitable moment when life contradicts everything you believe.;362;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1371836862m16179216.jpg;Dear Killer;mystery thriller crime;You guys.. Sometimes I read books that make me wonder how they get published. I hate being mean but this book was just plain horrible. Let me tell you that I went back four times to take certain sentences away and this is the best cursefree less snarky review I could come up with. There is no way to enlighten it with some positivism because there was not a single thing I enjoyed. If you dont like rants you better skip this.  Kit grew up as assassin and takes over when her mother is done with the job. I believe she was 9 when she started to learn this trade and she is now a 17yearold girl. The problem with this book is that its filled with plot holes unbelievable situations and a very unlikable main character.  Lets talk about the rules first. Rule OneNothing is right nothing is wrong. Combined with Rule FiveThe letters are the law. Kit is not supposed to play for God. She receives the letters in a mailbox that has been hidden in a toilet wall for years. Unrealistic concept aside (will return to this later) Kit isnt allowed to judge. They ask she kills. The only thing for me is I could NEVER EVER live with myself despite these rules. If these requests would have made sense perhaps I could understand it but the letters are too ridiculous for words.  Dear killer  my family has hit hard times. I love my husband. I really do. But I want you to kill him. Im not doing this because I hate him. Im doing this because I love my children. He has life insurance that could create a better life for us  dont you see And I dont think hed really be mad if he knew I was writing this letter.  Let me get this straight. You want your husband to be killed so you can use the money So instead of fixing this together like a normal family you rather lose him for life insurance None of the other letters were any better especially the case this book is all about. Kit is supposed to kill Maggie because she broke my heart until you find out that this Michael is harassing her and this girl is scared of him. Well there is of course a reason that Kit is able to do this and its just.. Im going to quote it. There is no other way to show you how hilarious this is.  They need a monster under their stairs. She smiled. The world is full of chaos. And its that chaos that joins people together. Scared people are more cohesive than people who arent scared. Its so clear  right there in the way they old on to each other. They need me. Because the people here in London start feeling so safe. And every once in a while they need a murder  just a tiny fragment of chaos  to remind them that they arent safe to remind them that they need each other to remind them that in the end its human relationships that matter.  Oh yes Kit you are a life safer Than you SO much for making everyones miserable life better by scaring them with your perfect murders. Thank you SO much for taking innocent lives to help us remember we need each other. You are an Angel I wonder where you freaking halo is.  Rule TwoBe careful. HAHA. Please allow me to laugh out loud because if there is one thing Kit sucks at its being careful. Her mother invites the young attractive guy who leads the search for this Perfect Killer. Of course its only a reason to introduce another lame person to the story. He is not only TOO young to ever get such an important task but he has to be gorgeous too. Well he is not the brightest in the bunch thats for sure. Its great for him that despite his obvious stupidity he is allowed to find the killer. Back to the rule. So Kit becomes best friends with this Alex and she hands him all kinds of information she actually couldnt know as outsider. For him thats only a reason to give her inside information and he even allows her on a crime scene. Are you kidding me Not very professional.  Not only is she allowed to give him information which could lead to herself in the end she is also found next to a body in school. Her wailing and desperate crying immediately get her of the hook as murderer. An innocent cute girl like her isnt possible capable of doing it right Or what about that time where she wants to murder a famous singer but she cant and she gets of the hook because shes a good girl. Uh okidoki.  Okay to return to the unrealistic concept of the mailbox. I quote again because I cant find the worlds to explain this idea myself.  None who had their requests filled even those tracked down and interrogated by the police ever confessed the location of my mailbox. The mailbox set a strange spell of silence over them. The police didnt know of that secret place and I was glad of it.  How is it possible that people know about this mailbox in the first place There is never explained how this all started. And its not a strange spell. Would you tell the location to that box if you are interrogated  which could possible mean that you confess you have written a letter and committed a crime  The last thing I want to rant about is Kit an infuriating girl. 17 year old and I must believe she is such a perfect killer that nobody can find her.. Okay. I can look past that seeing this is a book. (Although saying that they cant trace back to you because the dark carpet will hide the blood stains doesnt make it more realistic) What I cant ignore is how annoying she is. Becoming friends with your victim is never a good idea but finding out that this girl is innocent and then still want to continue with the murder Practically handing your identity to Alex All the conversations in her head and how she tries to talk everything right Just.. no. I was so relived when I reached the ending. Ugh.;Katherine Ewell

She is so kickass and strong in the first two books but there was something whiny about her in Lion Heart. I love that we get to see her vulnerable side but she cries often and has many break downs.

WAY. O  What am I supposed to do now  EDIT    httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book destroyed me. She stomped on my heart and completely shattered me. It contains all the feelings and this is a book where the inside is just as pretty as the outside. I do need to warn you for spoilers if you havent read Scarlet or the blurb for Lady Thief. I know some of you guys dont read blurbs. If you did its okay to read this review )  First off we have the kickass Scarlet. This girl has a special place in my heart. Fierce strong brave independent and snarky. Scarlet knows what she wants and she will do anything to achieve that but in the mean time she is desperate for love. Her romance with Robin is hard with her being married to Guy. I liked seeing their struggle and how they both want to be together. And guys I ship them so hard I cant get enough of their short moments of happiness. They are so adorable together and I was constantly swooning  a thing I dont do often.  But there is of course more to this story than romance. Luckily for us Gaughen knows how to write an engaging plot. Things are going to get complicated when Guy says he will ask for an annulment if Scarlet pretends to be the noblewoman she actually is. There is a tournament for the new sheriff and Guy wants to show her off because Prince John promised him the job.  Guy seriously creeps me out in this story. He was scary in Scarlet but he is even worse here. The only thing is Gaughen gave him more depth and complexity. There were almost moments I felt sorry for him  and it was weird because the next moment he would beat Scarlet for her obedience and I would hate his guts. The same for Prince John and his arrogant cocky look on the world.  Discovering more about Scarlet and the tension over the tournament was interesting but when we were nearing the end something heartshattering happened. I still cant believe it. I must applaud for the way Gaughen handled this because my oh my I definitely didnt see it coming. It makes me even more anxious for the next book and I already know its going to be painful.

Shepherds writingstyle is wasted on a book filled with irritating characters and a disgusting lovetriangle. I liked the overall story but I had a hard time trying to stop myself from throwing the book against the wall. Juliet is one of the worse characters Ive read about this year..  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I wish I could say Im not sure where it all went wrong because I know. This book suffers from the most horrible lovetriangle Ive seen last year and it contains irritating annoying characters. Juliet is probably one of the worst characters of 2013. The good writingstyle and overall interesting and unique storyline go to waste  and that is a true shame.  I always like to look positive at books. I dont enjoy writing negative reviews but it has to be done. There are mild spoilers for this book but I seriously recommend reading them to see for yourself if you want to suffer through this book.  I quite liked The madmans daughter. The vivisections were fascinating to me and I loved that Shepherd explored that side of science. That is also the case in this book. Juliet returned to London and is living with a professor. She is trying to find a new cure since her old treatment isnt working. When there are strange deaths on the island Juliet finds out that Edward survived and he is back to find her. His beast side is starting to take over and naive as Juliet is she believes they can find a cure for him too. So far I was interested in the story. I liked where everything was going and Shepherd has a good writingstyle.  The first thing that should have warned me was the moment Edward and Juliet meet. This meeting brings us to a scene I still cant believe happened. Edwards beast side just killed someone and Juliet finds him in her secret room covered in blood. Any normal girl would get the hell away right But NO wait there is something very dangerous about him so lets have sex with him Juliet has been complaining and whining over her long lost lover Montgomery and she is lonely. Surely Edward is the best way to forget about him. Dont mind the fact that HE FREAKING KILLED SOMEONE and that there is a beast lurking inside him.  And there was Edward who knew my secrets and didnt judge me for them desperate to fill that void in my life.  Seriously Of course a few days later Montgomery pops up Hes following Edward and wants to kill him. Juliet is confused about her feelings but something bigger is going on. A society is looking for Edward too and they want to use him for their experiments. This part of the story was great. I loved the tension and the mystery  who are involved and what are they doing  Its a shame that this mystery is completely overshadowed by these facepalming characters. Juliet is a spineless whiny awful creature. The only thing she can do is complain about her life making herself feel miserable and unhappy without a real reason. She is ungrateful and a horrible friend for Lucy. I was secretly hoping that the beast would come out to slash her throat but that obviously didnt happen. Another thing that annoyed me was her fickleness. First she is objecting about killing Edward because its not right. Two pages later she is planning to slaughter a group of men.  The other characters arent really memorable. I liked EwardBeast because he added some tension to the story. God knows why he loves Juliet so much. Montgomery is just.. Montgomery. Nothing too special.  And the worst thing of it all I still want to read the next book to see how its all going to end sigh;Megan Shepherd

To say that I disliked the second book Her dark curiosity would be an understatement. I absolutely LOATHED the sequel to The madmans daughter. There was nothing about the book I liked but based on the first book and the promise of A cold legacy I decided to give this series another shot. Its not only a good feeling to cross another series of my list Im also happy to announce this was much more enjoyable.  Warning dont read the blurb from this book if you dont want to spoiler yourself. Its safe to read my review if you havent read any of the books.  The thing I really liked about this series were the different scientific experiences. I love that Shepherd decided to explore that side of science and it was wellwritten and detailed. In this book we get to see Juliet and her attempts to bring someone back to life. That was my favorite part of the book filled with bloody and gore details. The Frankenstein twist was nicely incorporated into the storyline and this shows that Shepherd knows how to write an engaging story.  The setting was creepy. Juliet and her interesting friend group escape after a big happening in London. They arrive on the remote estate from Elizabeth where mysterious things are going on. Juliet starts to wonder if they havent arrived in another dangerous place like her fathers island. The bodies in the basement the strange noises I couldnt get enough of it. It gives a haunting atmosphere and it makes sure there isnt a boring moment. There was also a surprising twist at the ending of the book. It was great Shepherd made that decision and I didnt see it coming. I thought it would be more cliched but she went with a more realistic approach.  The only thing that still let me down were the characters. I have a lovehate relationship with Juliet. In the first book I was charmed by her the second book made me want to stab her and my feelings are a little indifferent when it comes to A cold legacy. She has her bright moments and I admire her scientific work. Its great to see what she is capable of if only she could let go of her naivety and sometimes downright stupidity. I like that she is loyal towards her friends and her worries felt realistic but she could use a good shake every now and then.  I give zero fucks about Montgomery and Lucy. Edward is the only character I was interested in because he is such a complex figure. Montgomery holds information back from Juliet and he seems to think he can change her. It seemed to me there were moments where he tries to kill her passion for science. Its definitely a dangerous path she tries to take but love is also about supporting each other.. Lucy was an egoistic annoying whiner.  Altogether Im not sure if its a series I would highly recommend but if we forget the tragic Her dark curiosity I would say its a pretty solid story with an interesting science aspect.  SPOILER  There is one thing I dont understand. How on earth do you cut of BOTH of your own hands without any help Like.. HOW;Megan Shepherd

Im definitely going to check out the first book The Sevenfold spell.  It all starts with two separate stories. Richard is connected to the mirror from The Evil Queen of Snow White (whose name is Ange here). She can ask him three questions every day and he must answer them with the truth. He is very clever in giving useless answers. I liked the way he tricked her into wasting her questions. Richard wants to slip into the castle to break the mirror so he is free from the curse. That is how he sees Ange a girl he met somewhere in the past. When the Queen wants to kill her Richard warns the girl and Ange flees to a place she visits often a dwarf farm.  This brings us to the other story. Gretchen has been teased all her life for being small. I respected her for the way she deals with the bad treatment. When she hears the story of a farm populated by little people she decides to go there to find a husband. Lars is the lucky one. I was so happy that there was no instantlove. They are attracted to each other but their feelings got enough time to feel realistic. Lars is a sweetheart and he makes Gretchen feel pretty. Her character development was great and it was good to see that she starts to realize that she is beautiful the way she is. Another good aspect was her family. Gretchen is 27 and she lives with her parents. They are very supportive and caring. They accept and love her for who she is.  I liked the way these two stories came together. The plot was interesting and there is a constant pace. Everything happened in the right time and I was never bored. The writingstyle was quick easy and had that old fairytalish feeling. The only thing that made this book a bit harsh is the fact that a character is trying to rape Gretchen. I think that this book is a mix between YA and Adult. If you are looking for something new when it comes to fairytales this is the book you want to pick up.;Tia Nevitt

The other was homely and odd an outcast from birth. An opposing pair plucked from youth and spirited away.This year best friends Sophie and Agatha are about to discover where all the lost children go the fabled School for Good  Evil where ordinary boys and girls are trained to be fairy tale heroes and villains. As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life.

A bit too long towards the ending but yeah D also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  The school for good and evil and me clicked. From the moment I saw the cover and the blurb I knew I was going to love this book. It has everything I look for and it just screamed my name. While it didnt blow me away as much as I wanted I thought it was extremely enjoyable and fun. Im looking forward to other books from Chainani. Plus this book has one of the most gorgeous maps Ive ever seen And I love the drawings at the beginning of every chapter.  Summary.  This book introduces us to two characters who are each others opposites. There is Sophie  the girl who finds herself a princess. She is often described as beautiful with her long blond hair. There is also Agatha  the lonely girl who loves to be alone in her house at the edge of a cemetery. Despite all odds the girls develop something that looks like friendship.The two girls live in a village where every 4 year two girls are kidnapped by someone they call The school master. Some of these children will play a role in a fairytale story which is sold at a bookshop where the books magically appear. Some of them are just gone and lost forever.Sophie is eager to leave and she knows for sure that she is going to play the role of a princess. But when she and Agatha are swept away to The school for good and evil something strange happens. Agatha is dropped at good and Sophie ends up in evil. The two girls do everything to switch houses until Agatha starts to understand that they might be in the right place after all.  Review.  One of the things that bothers me is Sophie. She is not likable at all. She starts her friendship with Agatha because she believes this is one of her good deeds to help her end up as a princess in a tale. She is unkind egoistic shellfish and most of the time plain stupid. There was nothing about her I liked and she really got onto my nerves. I know that she is supposed to be evil but there was nothing about her I could appreciate. I wish there was some part about her I could like  and her true good deed at the ending didnt do the job for me.  Luckily Agatha shines in every good aspect. She is kind loyal and friendly. Its funny that this girl prefers to be alone because she is one of the best friends out there. I also liked the fact that she isnt extremely beautiful I tend to dislike characters like that. Sophie shows that being pretty isnt everything and most of them are arrogant and think they can look down upon people with less beauty. Agatha knows how to deal with Sophies annoying behaviour (credits for that) and she will do anything to help her friend find her happily ever after. There are some interesting sidekicks but they are a bit underdeveloped.  The plot was good but it took some time to get started. The middle part of this book was a bit too long and would have been much better with less pages. I was still very intrigued by the real reason for the school and I couldnt wait to see what was going to happen at the end  and I was pleased with the conclusion. I liked how the author created this fairytale world and I was fascinated by the worldbuilding. I felt like walking around their school together with them.Overall an interesting take on fairytales but I wished it was a bit shorter and I disliked Sophie too much. Ill be continuing this series to see where Chainani is going to take it  and how could I ever resist a fairytale retelling;Soman Chainani

The overall feeling of this book was meh to me. I really liked the beginning and ending but the middle part dragged. I was bored and I definitely had some moments where I wanted to DNF it but after reading other reviews who raved about the ending I decided to give it a chance. Im happy I did because the story picks up and leaves us with a huge cliffhanger. Im most of the times not a fan of those but I liked the timing to end the story. Im between a 2.5  3 stars but I feel generous today.  The story starts with Lia running away after getting ready to marry to a stranger. Her father married her off to a neighbor kingdom for an alliance but Lia isnt planning on being used. She wants her own life and her own happiness she wants to pick her own husband. Together with her maid Paulina Lia manage to escape to a small village where she works in the inn from Paulinas aunt. One day two attractive and mysterious guys appear in the village. One is darkhaired and gloomy the other fairhaired and flirty. One of the is the prince. One of them is an assassin from Venda.  Lia starts a short romance with one of them but the other also has his eyes on her. You dont know their identity and that was a fun twist to the story. The only downside is that I already guessed who they were. I wouldnt say there is instalove but there is definitely instaattraction and the dreaded line  Because ever since that first day I met you Ive gone to sleep every single night thinking about you and every morning when I wake my first thoughts are of you. When Im not with you I wonder where you are. I wonder what youre doing. I think about how much I want to touch you loads of other crap.  Im not blown away by the romance itself. I dont feel a lot of connection between Lia and the guy. There could have been more development and chemistry if you ask me but I was already happy that she didnt want to get his babies after their first meeting. Lia was a pretty good character. I like that she stands up for her rights and how clever she is. They cant find her after her escape because she threw everyone off with her tricks. Shes also not afraid to speak her mind and she is not arrogant or lazy. Her unique friendship with Paulina was nice.  Another thing that let me down was the worldbuilding. I still have no clue what being a First daughter exactly means. I know you are supposed to have the gift of sight but where does it come from why that name etc Overall an okay book that makes me want to read the sequel after the openending.;Mary E. Pearson

This book was perfect for this month where I decided to pick up some books to get in the Halloween mood. It started out very creepy and those pictures completed the book. Im really starting to fangirl about books where they include pictures like In the shadow of blackbirds and The cure for dreaming.  The first thing we find out is that Jacobs grandfather used to tell him stories about his life in an orphanage during the war. He would show Jacob pictures from his old friends alongside tales about monsters and special powers. The last few years Jacob figured out these were nothing more than fantasies  but then something shocking happens and he sees a glimpse of one of the monsters his grandfather used to describe to him. His parents are afraid Jacob cant deal with the situation and they send him to therapy. Its then that Jacob decides he wants to see the island to solve the mysterious words from his grandfather.  I loved the mystery. I had no idea what was going on and if Jacob truly saw the monster or if his imagination was playing with him. The big question was solved about halfway into the book and I wasnt let down by the answer. There were enough other things to make it interesting after that. I dont want to give anything away so this is pretty much everything I can say about it. Going in with as little information as possible really made this book work for me.  The setting was great. An island with an abandoned orphanage on it Yes please Ransom had a fantastic way of incorporating those pictures in the story to make the picture complete. When his grandfather would show him a picture of a girl we would find that specific photograph on the next page. It made the story very interactive and it gave a haunting atmosphere.  The ending left me wanting more. Its not a bad cliffhanger though. A lot of problems are solved but youll be exited for the sequel I cant wait.;Ransom Riggs

That was a fascinating story.I was hooked from the beginning. Our brains are so interesting.    also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com 4.5 stars.  Dark gripping and gritty those are the three words that pop in my head when I think about this book. Despite that there is always a certain touch of hope. I never felt depressed or overwhelmed by this tough subject. The easy writingstyle and Angie made this a very enjoyable good book. I finished this book a couple of days ago but I still think about it. It definitely had an impact on me and I see myself rereading this book in a few years.  I think its very clear by now that Im fascinated by everything that has to do with biology. The fact that our body is capable to adapt to certain situations is amazing. In this case its about Angie and her brains way to survive a kidnap for three years.  Summary.  Angie went camping as a 13 year old girl and she returned home as a sixteen year woman. She has no idea what happened in those three years and she has a hard time to adapt to her new life. Her body doesnt fit to her thoughts and her fathers behavior is confusing. To help her understand her lost years she is sent to a psychologist. That is when they find out how Angies amnesia started she created several characters in her head. These real persons  they are capable of taking over her body and presence  are holding the secrets and clues of her past. But is Angie ready to confront them  Review.  I really liked Angie. She is confused and scared but also strong and determined to pick up her life. When she loses control over her mind and body she isnt afraid to step up. Her moments of pity were realistic and understandable but shes not a whiner. I respected her and her choices despite the fact that some broke my heart. I suspected the twist at the ending but it was heartbreaking nonetheless.  The other persons in her head were interesting. It was great to see how they were created and I was constantly eager to continue for more information. The mystery around her past is slowly unravelled and I felt so sorry for Angie. She has such a kind spirit and Im happy that she never lost her innocence because the real Angie was protected. Its almost unbelievable that this DID syndrome exists.  What I also really liked was the fact that we see the impact on her family and the reaction of her old friends. Her parents feel guilty and they try to cope with the situation in their own way. I first didnt get her fathers reaction but I started to understand him.  The only thing I didnt believe was the media silence. I dont think that they can keep a kidnapping quiet for such a long time. But its a great book and I recommend it to everyone.;Liz Coley

I like to think of them as poisoned apples.

I really enjoyed the stories but they are in need of extra care. Im not sure how I feel about them right now. also on httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.com  This is such a hard book to review Im still not sure about the rating. I really liked the twist to the stories from the Brothers Grimm. According to this book the Brothers Grimm altered the true fairytales. The immortal characters from those tales lived among us until there was a cursed placed upon them. They were buried in their own dreams the Dreamworld. Some of the Immortals broke the curse and they could wake up once every hundred years. The good ones want to tell the truth about their fairytales the bad ones want to bring wrath on our world. Everything is documented in a Book of Sand also called the Grimm Diaries. You are now reading part of those diaries.A lot of character are mentioned in this book and I liked how the puzzle pieces fell together. You can see that the author did his research and his worldbuilding is good.  Let me walk you through the diaries  Snow White Blood Red (The Grimm Diaries Prequels 1)This is the story of the Queen of Sorrow also known as the Evil Queen from Snow White. In this diary we get to know the real truth behind her and her daughter (yes not her stepdaughter) The Evil Queen is actually trying to protect the Kingdom of Sorrow instead of hunting the girl down for her beauty. She banished Snow to the Dreamworld so she can find the Lost Seven to kill the immortal Snow White. She must find out who these Lost Seven are by identifying their objects.This was a nice story. It was fun to see the first lies from the Brothers Grimm and I almost felt sympathy for the Evil Queen.  Ashes to Ashes and Cinder to Cinder (The Grimm Diaries Prequels 2)This is the story of Alice Grimm. She is a descendant from the Brothers Grimm and she is able to locate the fairytale characters. Its her job to remind them in the Dreamworld who they are. When she flies to Venice to an 800 hundred year old witchs skeleton Alice knows this is her chance to find one of them. Together with Dreamhunter Loki she dives into Dreamworld.While I liked the idea of Grimms descendant I had some trouble with Alice and Loki. Their dialogues were a bit uninteresting. I wanted to see more of the story instead.  Beauty Never Dies (The Grimm Diaries Prequels 3) Peter Pan is in love with one of the immortal monsters and to wake her up he wakes Dracula. He is also important to the Evil Queen because he can help her with the lost Seven.While I liked the idea of Peter and his love for one of the characters I didnt like the language in this story. Peter is trying to show off his good body to the Queen by walking around half naked. She is brushing him off by using worlds I found every unEvil Queenlike (and yes that is a word from now on haha.) Not that it matters but this is my favorite cover from the prequels. Very pretty.  Ladle Rat Rotten Hut (The Grimm Diaries Prequels 4) Little Red Riding Hood isnt just some girl. She is given an important role in life and when she reaches the age of sixteen she will find out. One of her first tasks is going into the woods to bring a basket of food to her grandmother.I dont want to give away too much of the story because the author manages to surprise me. I liked the dark undertone in this story and it was fun to see what the title means. This was one of the better prequels.  Mary Mary Quite Contrary (The Grimm Diaries Prequels 5) Death is watching one particular girl when an enchanted mirror cracks. Some of the splinters ends up in her heart and it makes her a great evil. But one day her dark practices unleashes an even bigger treat into the world. Death must do something and he locks the evil spirit away in a mirror. The same mirror that talks to the Evil Queen.The background to the mirror awesome. I liked that a lot. But this story was actually.. horrible. This is an example of in need of editing. When Death is talking with words like duh told ya and WTF Im gone..  Blood Apples (The Grimm Diaries Prequels 6) Prince Charming is working together with Jack the Beanstalk to save his love Snow White from the tower from Rapunzel.This was okay. I liked the fact that we finally know why the apples are red instead of their original golden color. The appearance of Jack was fun and I liked how their is a real fairytale undertone in this story you will do everything for the one you love. You can even look beyond the fact that they are a monster.  Conclusion  These prequels promised me a lot for the upcoming books. Ill definitely give them a try because I can see how much fun Cameron had while writing these books. I appreciate the twists on the stories the way he used a lot of characters and how he built these two worlds. These stories read incredibly fast and they are worth a shot but you can see that he needs an editor. The reason why I decided to stick with 2.5 flowers is the fact that some of the sentences and words dont fit into the story. The ideas are better than the execution.;Cameron Jace

This was a hard review to write because I dont have much to say about A thousand pieces of you. This is a typical 3star book for me. It was good but nothing spectacular and I think I will forget about this soon. But for now let us stare for a while at the beautiful cover stares  Marguerites dad recently passed away and shes trying to deal with the fact that its all because of Paul her parents beloved assistant. He escaped into another dimension with their invention the Firebird so when Theo gives her the opportunity to follow Paul into different dimensions she jumps right into this adventure. Its time to get her revenge.  I was surprised by the setting of this book. Parallel universes can be quite tricky but Claudia crafted a nice balanced explanation with enough information to make sense without getting too overwhelming. There is another personality of you in every parallel universe and when you jump you take over that body until you jump again. Sure there were things that didnt make sense (where stays your body in your real life) but Ive seen worse. I liked how every Marguerite had her own way of living and shes even a Princess is one of them. That was by far my favorite universe.  Marguerite was sometimes a bit naive and it was easy to make her believe you but she wasnt stupid. This gave her a flawed realistic personality I warmed up for. Its great how she was set on getting revenge for her fathers death. It was obvious she had a good relationship with her family and I think I would do the same without any hesitation. I also liked how her unique ability to have no memory loss after a jump isnt emphasized too much. I often have a feeling the author try to make us feel the main character is the most special girl in the world. Here its just something that sets her apart from other jumpers. Its a dangerous gift.  I wasnt sure how I felt about Theo or Paul and how this turned out into a hint of lovetriangle. Its nothing too bad or overwhelming  this book is all about setting up other dimensions  but it could have been avoided. I did have a preference for Paul and I was quite charmed by him when Marguerite. The romance was nevertheless a very weak part in this book.  Like I said it wasnt a bad book by any means but not very memorable. Im still curious about the sequel though. This book held a good promise for more.;Claudia Gray

I would never have bought this book if it was for the cover but Im happy I didnt let it scare me away. Thanks to the awesome promise my name and the glowing reviews I took it with me when I visited the bookstore. I was hooked from the moment I opened it Im going to stay as vague as possible because I want you guys to go blind in this book like me. I recommend being that you are careful with reading reviews on Goodreads.  This book starts with Melanie. She is locked in her room and every day she gets strapped to a wheelchair before she is wheeled into her classroom together with her other wheelchairbound classmates. At first you have no idea what is going on but with pieces of information its not hard to puzzle together what is wrong with the children. When the base is attacked Melanie escapes with an interesting mix of people Helen Justineau the teacher she adores Sergeant Parks doctor Caldwell and soldier Kieran Gallagher. Together they must find their way back to another base but the road is long and they are not alone..  It was such an intense story. The world is torn apart after a pandemic that influences every infected person. The mysterious thing is that some people are able to overcome this infection and they are capable of functioning like a healthy person. I loved the moral questions in this book and how provoking it was. How far can you go to save humanity The fact that you see the situation through different eyes (in third POV) is interesting and I could understand doctor Caldwells obsession with finding a cure. Im not saying she was right but I could see where she was coming from. But when you shift to Helen and her relationship with Melanie the story messes with your feelings again. It was heartwarming to see them together and their somewhat strange bond.  I must say that it was fun to see my name in this book and Im not ashamed Melanie is a wonderful character. She is loyal to the woman she loves as a mother (Helen) she is brave and intelligent. I liked her perspective on matters and I think Mike did a good job on her voice. She has a voice that fits a girl of her age. I also liked how everyone had their distinctive voices and specific role in this story. It worked really well together.  The explanation for the outbreak was simply amazing. Coming from someone who is going to work in the field of microbiology I was happy to see this explored. Its very clear that Mike spend a lot of time on researching this matter. I thought it was wellexplained and terrifying because things like this could happen.  Some parts might have been a little slow but I was swept away in their journey to safety. They come across some scary and bloody situations. If you look for a book with a realistic portrayal of human feelings moral questions thrilling scenes and medical backgrounds this is the book you want to pick up.;M.R. Carey

This book is a huge mindfuck. I seriously had no idea what was going on and I still have a feeling I dont get the ending. lts probably at bit too spiritual to me and it just didnt make any sense. Which is a shame because I enjoyed the writingstyles and the characters. Up to 71 I was thinking around a 4 star rating but with that strange and unfinished ending Im not sure anymore. Its more around 23 and Ive a feeling this book could have been more than this. This is also a very difficult review to write but Ill do my best.  This book starts with an intense scene. You are immediately plunged into the story a boy is drowning and he dies. But he wakes up in the middle of the street. Its an abandoned city and he soon finds out that he is back in England in the house he grew up in. When his life was happy before the incident around his little brother.  The city is abandoned. There are no people no animals and Seth finds himself alone and confused. He has the vague idea that he is in Hell and the whole situation is just so bizarre. Together with Seth we have NO CLUE what is going on. During his search for answers he teams up with two other kids who save him from a dangerous and mysterious man. This part gave me the creeps. Regine and Tomasz share their suspicion about this strange world with him and the whole idea is rather mindblowing. I adore Tomasz and his brave quirky actions.  What I also liked were the flashbacks to Seths past in the form of dreams. It was interesting to see piece by piece what happened and why he grew up to be such a troubled sad boy. There were several times where I wanted to hug him and tell him everything was going to be all right. So when it comes to characters Ness did a great job in painting them. They felt realistic and I was scared and anxious together with them. I was rooting for them and the mystery and weirdness was fascinating and annoying at the same time.  This book would have been so much better with a more conclusive ending. I just felt I missed something. Perhaps I just dont get the whole meaning of this but I wanted more answers.

Now she begins an allnew and enchanting series that will transport readers to a magical vision of ancient Ireland...In exchange for help escaping her long and wrongful imprisonment embittered magical healer Blackthorn has vowed to set aside her bid for vengeance against the man who destroyed all that she once held dear. Followed by a former prison mate a silent hulk of a man named Grim she travels north to Dalriada. There shell live on the fringe of a mysterious forest duty bound for seven years to assist anyone who asks for her help.Oran crown prince of Dalriada has waited anxiously for the arrival of his future bride Lady Flidais. He knows her only from a portrait and sweetly poetic correspondence that have convinced him Flidais is his destined true love. But Oran discovers letters can lie. For although his intended exactly resembles her portrait her brutality upon arrival proves she is nothing like the sensitive woman of the letters.With the strategic marriage imminent Oran sees no way out of his dilemma. Word has spread that Blackthorn possesses a remarkable gift for solving knotty problems so the prince asks her for help. To save Oran from his treacherous nuptials Blackthorn and Grim will need all their resources courage ingenuity leaps of deduction and more than a little magic.;434;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1396748896m17305016.jpg;Dreamers Pool (Blackthorn  Grim 1);fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  People who follow me for a long time might get tired of this but Im going to repeat it again I love Marillier and shes one of my favorite authors. Her books always have something magical to me and while this first book didnt live up to Daughter of the forest I really enjoyed it and Im impatiently waiting for the sequels.  This book tells the story of three different point of views Blackthorn Grim and Oran. Their separate stories come together to craft an interesting plot that hold few surprising twists but it managed to hook me to the story nevertheless.  Blackthorn and Grim share a prison. They are both captives for different reasons but it is clear that Blackthorn is deeply traumatized and broken by something that happened in the past. She is out for revenge after she will be released until she hears they are not planning to let her go. A mysterious guy offers her a way out. Desperately she takes his offer and conditions which ends in her and Grim living in a small house tuck away in the forest in Dalriada.  This happens to be the place where Oran is going to live with his soontobebride. The naive boy has fallen in love with her kind words and portraits but when they meet she is nothing like he imagined. He approaches Blackthorn and she finds out that something disturbing is going on with Flidais. Im going to start right away with saying that Blackthorn isnt the easiest character Ive seen. Marilliers other protagonists are much more likable but slowly you get to see what Blackthorn had to suffer through and it made her actions understandable. She is afraid to let people close and it is hard to adapt to her new life while her rage is consuming her. I saw glimpses of a sweet personality that she hides underneath her harsh mask and I think we will see great development of her.  Grims POV felt a bit unnecessarily to me but at the same time I loved the different writingstyle Marillier used to give him his own voice. There is more to him than weve seen so far and Im curious about his story. I feel his POV was mostly meant to show another side of Blackthorn but I could have done without it. Oran wasnt too bad. He already changed throughout the story and he has a good heart. I already saw the twist coming about what happened to his bridetobe but I was still impressed how it was handled.  Another thing I appreciated was the lack of romance for Blackthorn. Marillier always stays away from the typical lovetriangles and instalove. Instead she creates a beautiful world and interesting characters. It is also clear Blackthorn isnt ready for romance so its good she doesnt force it into the story as a cliche most YA books seems to fall for. If you have never read a book by this author before I suggest taking a look at her other work first. You could always take a look at my reviews for Hearts blood and Wildwood dancing. I think this book will mostly be loved by firm Marillier fans.;Juliet Marillier

Sybella is such a fascinating character. Its very clear that she is wounded and broken but she knows how to hide that because of her strong spirit and her ability to kill man without effort. I admire her strength and intelligence. She is fierce. It was beautiful how she grows. She starts to embrace herself especially after the short meeting with her true Father Mortain.  Her romance with Beast is one of the best Ive ever read. Their feelings are build on mutual respect and their ability to see each other for who they truly are. He is capable of embracing all her darkness and she can see past his ugly appearance. Its heartwarming to see them together and how they perfectly complete each other. I also like how he first doesnt want to sleep with her because there is no need to give that to him to conquer his heart. His love is already hers. I wish every author wrote their romance like this. Its on the background but is also essential for the story.;Robin LaFevers

Is this book the best book Ive ever read No it isnt but its clever and funny enough to make it highly entertaining. There is an antiheroin a sarcastic girl a cute boy and one who looks very arrogant at the outside but it actually sweet on the inside. This combined with action and demons makes this book an enjoyable ride  Like the blurb says Meda is a souleater because her father was a demon and that makes her a halfling. Her mother turned that into something good by letting her feed on bad people. Meda can hunt these people down by making a connection with spirits who haunt the earth looking for closure.  When Meda is on a mission in an asylum she comes across three demons who want to bring her with them. She is rescued by a dashing boy a Crusader whose mission on earth is to protect Beacons (people capable of doing something really good) from demons. The Crusader Chi wants to bring her inside his circles. Meda is more than happy to play the part because she is desperate for answer. Her mother always told her she was the only one and now a whole world with demons and crusades have appeared to her. Chi is joined by a girl with a cripple leg called Jo and a cutiepie called Uri.  Its fun to be in Medas head. She is tough and blunt but it wasnt difficult to connect with her. It was realistic for a half demon and I appreciated her a lot. Jo doesnt trust Meda at all. I loved this girl from the moment we met her. She is broken and hurt but tries to hide that by sarcastic and harsh replies. She is not easy to be around with but there was something about her that clicked with me. That is the great thing about these characters they are all flawed and therefor realistic. And credits for the lack of romance because that wouldnt fit in this book. Its there but its on the background.  I also liked where the story was going to. Demons are terrorizing their hiding place and they want to claim Meda. This gives much action and Crewe knows how to write those scenes. I liked how we slowly unravel what is going on along side Meda (although I guessed some parts) and the ending is how I like it. Everything is wrappedup but there are still a lot of things to discover.  Overall a fun book and Im looking forward to more;Eliza Crewe

The whole timetravel part always bugs me but the first part of the book is great. I also dont like how much clash there is between the three of them. I understand everyone is tense but I like it best when they are working together.  I loved the tension I had the first time I read this book when Sirius breaks into Hogwarts. The moment you still believe he wants to kill Harry and then suddenly the story shifts. Great.  Still interesting how no one was able to see Pettigrew on the map.

A good conclusion to a solid Dystopian series. Its not the most memorable story ever but if you want an interesting story that delivers constant quality you might want to give this series a shot. There are no hard spoilers for any of the books.  AddieEve are still on the run and they cant refuse the proposal from Marion a supporter who claims she wants to help hybrids but is mainly looking for a good story for her career. She knows a way to free Jackson the boy Addie fancies and she will help them if they provide her with inside information. AddieEve are locked away in another institute with a hidden camera. This is only the beginning from a lot of trouble.  I like that Eve takes a more prominent role in this story. In the first two books Addie is most of the times in control but she is more on the background. I still like Eve the best so I was happy with this switch. The thing about the two girls is that they both are rash and they dont seem to value their life much. They take dangerous decisions and there were some times where they throw themselves into situations with no happy ending  and they should know that. I found them a bit too naive and it made me want to smack both of them.  Despite those flaws they were good characters. I could see they were willing to sacrifice a lot for their friends and that is an admirable trait. Their relationship is still fascinating but I also liked their interactions with other characters like Jackson and Ryan. I felt less chemistry between them all than in the previous books but thats mostly because a lot of drama is going on.  They are constantly on the run and trying to stay under the radar especially because Jenson is looking for them. When AddieEve are put in the institute we truly get to see the horrible things they do to hybrids. They are kept in prison under bad conditions waiting until they go crazy and then they are taken away nobody knows that happens after that. It was a disgusting situation and its a good thing someone was trying to broadcast it.  The ending wraps everything up nicely but doesnt make it too happilyeverafter. It was fitting for the story and I was satisfied how everything is solved. When it comes to Dystopian series this is one that doesnt provide something unique but it manages to deliver a solid story with a good conclusion and sometimes thats more than enough for me.;Kat Zhang

The most interesting thing about this book was the ending. Some people warned me about it but when I finally read the conclusion it was a lot more satisfying then expected. If you loved the tale from The Raven boys youre going to devour this book too.  There are small spoilers for the first book.  The first book was more about all the characters with a mild focus on Adam. This book is mainly about Ronan definitely the most fascinating Raven Boy to me. He is a dream thief a person who can take objects from his dreams into the real world. Dangerous people are after this gift but they dont realize its a boy they are all looking for an object. This is how the Gray Man comes into the story. He is a complex character with history of killing but he is done when he is finally settling down in Cabeswater. The only problem is that his employer still wants what he hired him for.  I liked this book even when it blew a hole in my ship. Ronan was a mysterious silent boy in the Raven Boys and I feel like I know him a lot better now. He has his own way for dealing with things that bother him. He is not an easy character but I started to appreciate him more. I also admired how Stiefvater handled some things around him. his love life. He shows a good character development and I cant wait to see more of him.  Adam was different. Waking up the ley line changed him  and I dont think I like that. Its great that he has a new role but I dislike how easily he shuts people out. He is too proud for his own good and I want him to be more part of the group. There were some scenes where I wanted to shake him in the hope to open his eyes. Its obvious how damaged this boy is after growing up in an abusive environment.  I warmed up for Gansey. I like how he deals with his growing feelings for Blue and how passionate he is. A lot of people would have stopped with their quest but he has a positive look on things. I admire characters who stay strong despite setbacks. Blue is a wonderful girl. She is so feisty and sassy I think we could be best friends in real life. She knows what she wants and she wont let other people tell her otherwise.  There are also a lot of other interesting side characters. Persephone is still my favorite one. She is so dreamy. The addition of the Gray Man was nice because he brings another kind of romance into the story. We have the tension between Blue and a Raven Boy and the growing attraction between the Gray Man and someone from Blues family. Im happy that this stays on the background because the mystery around the ley line is great. I look forward to Blue Lily Lily Blue;Maggie Stiefvater

It was now two years ago since Ive reread the series and Im having so much fun. Rediscovering things and seeing situations with different eyes because of all the extra information J.K Rowling has given us over time its always an amazing journey.  Its home.  One thing I never thought about and I suddenly realized it Ron has so much troubles with spells because he is using Charlies wand. We already know you can only perform well when you have a wand that choose you so poor Ron is working extra hard.  It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that.  That mirror always seemed cruel to be. How dangerous to see your deepest desire reflected in a mirror. Like with Dumbledore He saw his family alive whole and happy  Ariana Percival and Kendra all returned to him and Aberforth reconciled to him.  J.K Rowling.  I thought it was also interesting to see Quirrell after finding out how he met Voldemort (httppottermorespoilers.tumblr.com...)  Sassy Harry  Harry Potter Whats this  Petunia Dursley Your new school uniform.  Harry Potter Oh I didnt realise it had to be so wet.  I also like the explanation why the Dursleys kept Harry for all those years. It shows to me that they arent completely evil. Yes they are assholes and they made his life terrible but at the same time they kept him save and fed him. They could have kicked him on the street or dumped him in another family. Explanation  Very good question. As you know as we find out in book seven Petunia once really wanted to be part of that world. And you discover that Dumbledore has written to her prior to the Howler...Dumbledore wrote to her very kindly and explained why he couldnt let her come to Hogwarts to become a witch. So Petunia much as she denies it afterwards much as she turns against that world when she met Uncle Vernon who is the biggest antiwizard you could ever met in your life a tiny part of her and thats the part that almost wished Harry luck when she said goodbye to him in this book she just teetered on the verge of saying I do know what youre up against and I hope its OK. But she couldnt bring herself to say it. Years of pretending she doesnt care have hardened her. But Dumbledore appealed in the letter youre asking about so that part of Petunia that did remember wanting desperately to be part of the world and he appealed to her sense of fair play to a sister that she had hated because Lily had what she couldnt have. So thats how he persuaded Petunia to keep Harry. Good question.  J.K Rowling.  This made me giggle I always wondered how they got off the island  httpstepchildofthesun.tumblr.comp...;J.K.

Maggie shows again that she is a master. Its not my favorite installment in the series but she managed to put some twists and turns into the storyline that surprised me and Im already scared for my feelings in the sequel. There are mild spoilers for The Raven Boys and The dream thieves.  Blue is still searching for her mother who disappeared after she left a mysterious note. Maura is now part of the game and more players are ready to join. Gansey isnt the only one looking for Glendower and the dangerous Colin has arrived in town with his wife Paige. The battle is about to begin.  I loved the addition of new characters especially Jesse and Paige  although shes not a likeable character. She is meant to be a bitch but shes an intelligent and kickass one you sometimes have to admire. A complex villain who is going to play a bigger role if you ask me. Jesse was too adorable for words but I had to get used to the fact that his lines are written in caps lock. It was hard to imagine a guy screaming all the time.  I will always be a fan of sassy Blue who keeps proving herself as solid character. She struggles with her feelings for Gansey while she is trying to stay strong for the rest of her family. Its great that they are always a part of her life and DAMNED WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO PERSEPHONE She was still my favorite secondary character and I did not see that coming. Adam seemed to get more lonely by the minute and it pained me to see him turning away. There were points where I hoped he would change but Im afraid he will keep himself on the sideline. I loved his moments with Ronan though who is my favorite Raven boy at the moment and I can see where the ship comes from. They have an unique bond made out of banter and hidden kindness.  This series features one of the most slow and nervewrecking romances Ive ever seen (and I love every minute of it) You keep wondering what is going to happen with them because in the back of your head you are always aware she might kill Gansey and you still want them together. I have a terrible feeling we will be broken when we read the final.  The last thing I want to mention is that the plot felt a bit out of control which is why this is a 4star book. There was no clear point and with the jumps between POVs it was sometimes hard to see the destination of the story. At the same time I was hooked from the moment I began reading. There is something about Maggies writingstyle that is pure magic. The ending made up for the unfocused plot and has an interesting climax that makes me want to pick up the sequel right away.;Maggie Stiefvater

This book is twisty. The entire series is one build up towards this conclusion and I must admit that the ending let me down just a little. I thought we would get more answers and for some reason it was not as spectacular as I was anticipating. BUT that definitely does not mean it was bad because in the end I still count this series as one of my all time favorites.  The writingstyle is just as easy and flowy as in the other books. I found myself stuck in her incredible worldbuilding and it was hard to put it down.  SHIPS. ALL THE BEAUTIFUL SHIPS. SAIL MY PRECIOUS SHIPS SAIL.  I just want to hug all the characters.

If you read the blurb youve practically read everything that was interesting about this book. The only reason I finished it was because its an eARC and I was far enough to feel like ending it. I dont recommend trying to do the same. I was bored and annoyed at the same time.  This book supposed to tell about a kickass fighter called Riven who is actually from a parallel universe. She is in our world to find Caden a lookalike of someone called Cale. She is supposed to bring Caden with her but she comes in conflict with her sister who protects the boys. And in the end she comes to realize that things arent what they seem.  To keep things a little positive I liked the animated corpses who are controlled by nanobots. It was an interesting concept and the science aspect of this book wasnt too bad. Its a shame that the worldbuilding isnt more detailed and explained. That could have saved a part of this book but its just as lame as the plot. There were supposed to be twists but I saw them coming from miles. Our MC is clueless and blind which made me even more annoyed by her.  For someone who says she is emotionless because her father created her to be a strong smart soldier she sure feels a lot. She is afraid when they are hunted down she feels hate for her family she is attracted to Caden should I go on As far as I know all these things are emotions. When it comes to the strong part this girl fainted more in this book than I in my whole life (which is never if you are interested) Not to mention that she falls short on the intelligent part because damn this girl makes some stupid decisions. Luckily for her things come very easily.  With a deep breath I raise the staff I took off Vector Shae and prepare to do battle. But then the unexpected happens. Every single one of the Vectors stops in their tracks their arms and weapons falling to their sides eyes going blank and dull.  What also bothered me was Caden. Riven is a drilled fighting machine but he is equally strong and fast because he trained with her sister. Im sorry but is there something wrong with a stronger MC Does they really have to share credits when it comes to their fighting skills It was highly unbelievable to me and it showed again that girls apparently need to be outshined by boys. His character falls flat and he has no development whatsoever. He also says that his girlfriend is a bitch and the only reason he was together with her was because it was easy. Not to mention that she cheats on her with Riven.  Which brings me to the sappy romance. Riven turns into a lovesick girl when he is around. In just a couple of days they are making out and she is trying to ignore her feelings. She even cries a couple of times to add to her emotionless state. They have zero chemistry and it didnt add anything to the boring plot.  [image error]  Uhhh. Nope. Dont go wasting your time on this failed dystopian unless you are a fan of boring stupid characters lousy worldbuildings and chemistryless romance.;Amalie Howard

Its hard to point out how I exactly feel about it. This book had crazy potential to be amazing but instead it falls back into cliches and unoriginal storylines. I was mad after finishing it but at the same time I did finish it and it reads very quick.  There are several countries like the four named after seasons because thats the only weather they have. Each of these countries have their own kind of power provided by the Queen. One day Spring attacked Winter and wiped away the nation. The citizens are enslaved and their magic is stolen. A group of survivors managed to escape consisting of the future king Mather and his friend Meira  who is training to become a warrior. They will restore Winters magic no matter the prize.  Sounds pretty amazing doesnt it The first thing you will notice about this book is the worldbuilding. We are first thrown into a setup filled with infodumps but gradually you will be immersed by her creativity. I loved all those countries and how everyone got their own traits. For example Winterians have white hair pale skin and they handled the mines. I wish the details were handled with more care but the information was at least interesting.  Meira and Mather the two important characters of the story left me confused. Did I like them I guess I did.. but I didnt care about either of them and I missed a (realistic) character development. Mather pretty much stays the same. He whines a little about how useless he is for his country and he didnt strike me as the leadertype. His character is bland and I dont like how he treated Meira. You would think you would trust your best friend with important information about her life.  Meira changes but in an unbelievable way. In the beginning its clear that shes not good at closecombat. At the end of the book without further training she suddenly turns into a ninja who battles herself a way through a group of soldiers. I wish her character was more consistent. She wasnt a bad character but I will forget about her in a couple of days. The only one I really liked was Theron who immediately charmed me.  The BIG twist was something you can see coming when you start the book. After a couple of pages I was 99 I knew what was going to happen and I was right. I think this book will be more impressive if you dont guess the twist but its staring at you.  I wasnt impressed by it either. The book follows some of the basic storylines we see in fantasy and I expected more from it. If the author had put the same amount of work in the plot as she did with the worldbuilding it would have been mindblowing. Now I was underwhelmed. There is the traditional villain an end battle and an heroin who finds out information that changes her life.  Still.. I cant say I highly disliked it mainly because of the quick writingstyle the worldbuilding and Theron. I have hope for the sequel.;Sara Raasch

The burning sky is still my favorite installment but Im satisfied with the ending and how everything ties together. The beginning was a little difficult because I read The Perilous sea a while ago but soon I was wrapped into the story. There are minor spoilers for the series (if youve read the blurb you can read the review)  Iolanthe and Titus are still fighting against the Bane. He wants Iolanthe or he will destroy the entire realm. This means they have to find a way to infiltrate his crypt where he keeps his original body but their friend has terrible forecasts about Iolanthes fate.  I think you can see from my review that I wasnt entirely blown away. There were a few things that annoyed me. One of them is the missing worldbuilding like the previous books. I still wished we had more details about the world. It is not vital for the story and there is enough action to keep you occupied but afterwards I was still a little disappointed by the lack of it. It is one of the things I look for in a fantasy book so its sad there wasnt more time spend on creating a good structure.  This book also has one of my hated tropes Titus makes decisions for Iolanthe because he thinks he knows what is best for her. I seriously dislike it when characters lie and take important decisions for someone else. I could understand WHY he had the need to do so but it shows a lack of respect and it doesnt give any credits to her worth and talents. You simply cant go ahead and take matters into your own hands like that. He should value her role and opinions but instead he leaves her behind when everything is at stake. Not okay. Iolanthe is strong and stubborn like always. She stands up for herself and doesnt take Titus shit so kudos to her.  Their chemistry is still there and despite some of his missteps I ship it. I miss their banter like in The burning sky but they are cute together. Luckily the romance isnt the main topic in this series. Its on the background and sometimes pops up in dire situations but the focus is still on beating the Bane. Credits for that The author could have fallen into the whole romanceisthemostimportantthing trap but she stayed away from that and delivered an exciting ride filled with action and magic. Its a good solid series with a satisfying ending. I only wished it had given me more.;Sherry Thomas

This book made me happy because its finally another story that lives up to the interesting blurb (and beautiful cover) I want to thank HarperCollins for allowing me to read this book for their blog tour otherwise I might not have read this book anytime soon. The funny thing about this book is that its shelved under Adult and Young adult on Goodreads. I have to say that it feels like a mix between the two.  The overall plot is pretty basic but really worked for me. Summary Kelsea grew up with foster parents Carlin and Barty in order of her mother Queen Elyssa. After years of preparation she is collected on her nineteenth birthday by the Queens guard to become the 7th Queen of the Tearling. Kelsea feels unprepared especially when she finds out several people would like to see her dead. There is her uncle who has been Regent for all those years and there is the Red Queen of Mortmesne who attacked her country years ago. There is only peace because of a treaty and when Kelsea finds out what that treaty means she makes her first act as Queen.  Kelsea was an interesting character. I found her strong and intelligent. It is clear that being Queen is in her blood and that she is destined to make history. At the same time I like that she is a little naive and afraid for the consequences of her actions. She grew up far away from court so its not strange that it takes time to get used to her new life. I connected with Kelsea over her shyness and jealousy for beautiful people but sometimes she went too far. Its never good to be focused on looks. This is one of the flaws that made her realistic but also one of the things that bothered me. People might have problems with her but to me it felt like Kelsea was discovering herself. She is trying to find out who she is and what kind of Queen she can be  and I appreciated that.  The use of magic was subtle Kelsea uses her necklace to channel that power and it is clear she will develop the magic into a weapon. I cant wait to see what she will be capable of in the future. I liked the short switches to four other POVs because that made it easy to see why these characters made their decisions. There is Javal a guard at the gate her uncle Thomas the priest and the Red Queen. I cant wait to see more of the Red Queen she is a fascinating character and she makes disturbing choices in her life.  I also liked the side characters like MaceLazarus captain of the Queens guard and Fetch a thief that wears a black mask to protect his identity. While Kelsea is interested in Fetch there is no romance in this book and that was a relief. This book needed the basics for a story the worldbuilding and getting to know Kelsea. I must admit that the worldbuilding confused me. It seemed like it was set somewhere in the past but at the same time there are hints to drugs (like heroin) and they have J.K Rowlings books on the shelf. I hope the next book provides more answers and information.  This book is a great start for a new series and Im highly anticipating the sequel (in the hope to get more action because this story feels like a buildup to more. I dont think everyone is going to like the pacing in this book but I just loved it.);Erika Johansen

First I want to say Dont hit me Debby ) I tried but this book failed to impress me. I liked it thats for sure but I wasnt blown away. I honestly thought Id like this book much more than I did.. I think its because of my disconnection with the characters. If you are able to do that I think youre up for a very good book  We are immediately thrown into the story. Em and Flinn are locked away and are terrified for the person they call Doctor. He wants to know the location of some documents but they clearly arent willing to give it to him. When Em finds a paper everything points out that theyve escaped and tried to stop this from happening over and over again. This might be their last chance.  The story often switches back to the POV of Marina. I loved seeing these flashbacks because it makes the story and everyones choices easier to understand. I admired the way Cristin used these two POVs and how the stories entwined in the future. EmMarina are so different and that shows her development in a fun way. The downside was that I absolutely didnt like Marina. I thought she was a bit shallow whiny and naive. Em and Flinn are adorable together. I loved their chemistry and it was fun to see how their relationship started in the flashbacks. I was rooting for them and that was an enjoyable aspect of this book. But I didnt care for them as an individual. I couldnt fully connect with them.  I think another problem for me was the fact is that there werent any surprising twists. This book could have used a shocking revelation. I must say that Cristin did a great job on the timetravel but I have this annoying habit of overthinking. This makes timetravel always a strange thing I cant understand but her creation wasnt that hard.  This book does shine with its ending. It was intense Despite the fact that I didnt connect with Em  Flinn like I wanted I was starting to fear for them. I like the complex villain and seeing how he changed into that person. Its strange how people we knew our whole life can change in an entirely different person.  There were more than enough good things and Ill be reading part two for sure;Cristin Terrill

This series went downhill for me. I truly enjoyed the first book the second was less interesting and this came close to being a trainwreck. This story lost the charm of the previous books. There was something off about the characters and the storyline.  The story is in big lines about the Juniper Tree Cinderella and Little Brother  Little Sister. I still need to give him credits for the fact that he uses lesser known fairytales and manages to create a solid story with it. They are all combined in a fun mixture and the humorous tone is still there. It was an easy book to read and that saved The Grimm Conclusion from a DNF rating.  The biggest problem were the unsympathetic characters. I didnt connected with them and couldnt care less about their fate. Its been a while since Ive read this book and I dont even remember them. For me thats a bad sign because Im pretty good at memorizing books. They just arent memorable. There is also a strange twist where we end up in the modern world and this completely ruined the fairytale feeling for me. It felt like I was pulled out of the story and after that I couldnt enjoy it anymore. It was hard to return and it didnt blend in.  I dont think I would recommend this series. Its perfectly okay to read the first book because they are pretty much standalones but this wasnt good.;Adam Gidwitz Hugh DAndrade

Simply the best. I fell in love with The girl of fire and thorns and from that moment I knew Rae Carson was an author for me. She knows how to write and how to create characters you just have to fall in love with. This book about a girl with a magical ability to sense gold on a journey across America to join the Gold Rush is fantastic.  Dont go in this book thinking you will get a lot of fantasy though. This is more on the background and expect it will play a bigger role in the sequel but its more about a journey from a girl to a new future.  Leah Lee Westfall keeps her family together after het fathers sickness. He keeps promising that he will get back to work once his cough goes away but Leah and her mother both know that is not going to happen. When Leah returns home after a visit to the village her whole life is turned upside down. Her uncle claims her house and her life so she does the last thing she can think off she runs away. Her best friend Jefferson is on his way to the West and she wants to meet up with him to start a new life. Her magic ability to find gold is both dangerous and useful.  Leahs journey where she disguises herself as a guy named Lee is treacherous. Genderbender is one of my favorite things so I was happy this was incorporated into the story. I loved her strength and how she pulls it off to portray as a guy. First she has to deal with a difficult situation at home and then she manages to survive on her own in the wilderness. Even a robbery cant break her spirit. It was a tough road and a lot of people would have returned back home. She has a motivational way to look at life and I thought it was inspiring.  Leah also has her weaknesses. She isnt perfect and she makes mistakes which made her likeable and realistic. It is the same with Jefferson. He was flawed in such a way that he didnt turn in a cardboard character. I think its weird how he reacted in a certain situation but I think thats how humans are. Sometimes we do strange unpredictable things.  The focus between them is mainly on their friendship despite their obvious attraction and that was good. This part of the story doesnt need much romance but I look forward to the development between them. I think they were their best version when they were together and I think we are up for some swooning in the sequel. Their romance was a bit like the pace of this book a bit slow which fit the story perfectly but you got to be in the mood for it  Leah and Jefferson travel along a group of people and you start to get attached to all of them. The broad cast grows on you and Carson doesnt shy away to hurt you with some situations. Its something I always appreciate about authors because sometimes you got to be brutal to make a story realistic. And I want more of that    Fantastic. This book has the same feeling as The girl of fire and thorns. Great writing interesting characters and a vivacious plot.  There is a slower pace that fits the story perfectly. This is a more subtle tale of a girl traveling to a better future  dressed as boy. There is a slow burn romance a girl with incredible strength and trials.  Review will follow.;Rae Carson

I think its time for me to acknowledge that Lauren Oliver isnt my type of author when it comes to YA books. This book was a failure for me and I had the same troubles with the Delirium series. This story suffered from another incredibly annoying character and Ive spotted some inconsistencies. Her MG books are more captivating to me with adventure like The Spindlers and heartwarming friendship in Liesl  Po.  This book is in short about a tournament called Panic. Once you are a graduated senior you can participate to win a lot of money (as in 67.000 dollars this year). The thing is these tasks are incredibly dangerous and several people died or were severely injured in the past. Does this withhold people from joining Of course not. We follow two different characters and the reason they decide to join. Dodge wants revenge Heather is just a loser.  The first thing about this book was the writingstyle. I know many people love how she writes but I guess its just a personal taste when I say Im not a fan. There were also detailed parts that didnt add anything to the story for me.  If she didnt know Matt  the boy whod once applauded after she burped the alphabet whod even once noticed that she had a little period blood on the outside of her white shorts and not made a big deal out of it and pretended not to be grossed out  then..  Okay.  And apparently Heather has some kind of special eyes because it was too dark to see all the people in the water but she is still able to see a bit of dark blood streaking her kneecap when she banged her knee against a rock.  The second thing is the lack of worldbuilding. There are still many questions left and it makes this even more unbelievable. Who picks the jury Why those people Why are some tasks more dangerous than others arent they supposed to be equal How is it possible that the cops arent able to find them and to stop this madness And why arent there any parents looking out for their children I can go on for a while its just so strange and hard to believe.  [image error]  But here comes the part that annoyed me the most Heather. Please excuse me while I double facepalm and roll my eyes. She was even worse than Lena.  For a second she thought of telling him the truth that when Matt had dumped her she had understood for the first time that she was a complete and total nobody.  Yes because we all know we are worth nothing unless we are together with a boy They totally complete us girls and there is NO happiness without them. So when you are dumped by a boy youve been dating with please jump of a cliff and join a dangerous tournament too Perhaps add a horrible case of parenting and some sad stories to make it more exciting. I know what Oliver tried to do there but it felt like she tried to come up with every sad thing she could use. I might have worked if she dumped it all in the beginning but now it felt like too much and it didnt do anything to warm me up for Heather. Because this girl is not only dependent she is also egoistic  Heather felt nauseous and heartbroken all over again. No one should be allowed to be happy when you were so miserable  especially not your best friends. It should be a law.  Because her best friend is happy with another girl and she just got dumped by a loser.  [image error]  Dodge was a little better but he too had his annoying moments.  There were only 107 people in their graduation class out of the 150 whod started at Carp High freshman year. And she didnt even know his name.  HOW DARE SHE She has the nerves to not know your name while you arent friends. Because duh we are supposed to memorize every name from random person who is in the same year as you are  I thin its time to end my ranting because I feel mean and I dont particularly enjoy writing negative reviews. I guess this is my goodbye to any further YA work from Oliver. Ive tried I really did.

This book felt similar to Liz Coley  Pretty girl thirteen another book I really liked. This one is just as dark gritty and gripping and you cant help yourself  you have to fall in love with the main characters. It was hard to put down and I didnt finish is because I had to sleep.  Summary.  Carey and Nessa (short for Jenessa) were kidnapped by their mother years ago. She has been gone for a while now and the girls are running out of food until their father finds them. They are taken away from the only home they remember and they have to adjust to a complete new world food clothes school. Its especially hard for Carey who took the role of mother for her silent sister. She is suddenly just her sister but she has to watch Nessa close. The girl is starting to talk and Carey is afraid she might tell them their greatest secret. A secret which might risk Careys new life with her father his new wife and their stepdaughter Delaney.  Review.  This book felt very realistic. Carey sometimes longs for her simple life with just Nessa the only life she has ever know. Its hard for her to adjust but she will do anything to keep Nessa safe and happy. I liked the way she remembers the good side of their past because that life made her this awesome character. I understand that its hard to let go and I love how Murdoch portrayed her struggle.  Carey is so loving and sweet for Nessa. Their relationship is one of the best aspects of this book. These girls have suffered so much in their lives but they grew up to be admirable characters. Their bond is strong and one of the best Ive seen in a while. Its unbelievable that Carey is only fifteen years because it was easy to connect with her. My heart broke when I saw the way her mother treated her and the things she had to deal with. Nessa is cute and I was happy with the way she developed under her fathers care.  The side characters were perfectly described as well. Melissa is amazing she took Nessa and Carey under her wings like they are her own blood and she understands them. I had a hard time with Delaney but I started to warm up for her. After a while I started to understand that it must be difficult for her too. Their father is a bit underdeveloped but its clear that he loves his daughters and he will do anything to make them happy.  The writingstyle is great. Carey talks with an accent and that was subtle interwoven. It never bothered me and it felt very natural. The descriptions were good and some situations gave me tears. That doesnt happen very often so its a sign that her writing worked for me. The ending was a bit abrupt for my taste. I wasnt ready to part with Carey and Nessa yet.;Emily Murdoch

Confusing book  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Let me say this right away this book isnt going to be for everyone. Its slowpaced and character driven the worldbuilding needs more work and you have to deal with old traditional ways that suck. I liked it but there were moments I wanted more. This book feels more like a stepup for the real story but my overall opinion is that its enjoyable.  I am grateful for my father who keeps me good and sweet. I am grateful for my mother who keeps her own heart guarded and safe. I am grateful for my adviser who keeps me protected. I am grateful for the Path which keeps me pure. Ever after.  Aislynn is a disappointment. She cant control her magic  she is too close with her fairy godmother and she is disobedient. The leader of the Nerine Academy is afraid she will stray away from her Path especially since her best friend disappeared. She is send to another academy to be Redirected instead of dazzling parties and handsome princes Aislynn will be trained to become a fairy godmother. Hidden away in the clothes of her new function Aislynn becomes the godmother of princess Linnea. When Aislynn receives a mirror from her old fairy godmother she finds out there is a lot more going on at her academy.  The world where Aislynn lives in is hard. She is constantly punished for the fact she cant perform the magic tasks they ask from her. She is badly treated and pushed around without having anything to say about it. I was fascinated by the Path and how people can stray and become outcasts like the Wicked Queen Josetta. When the Academy decides you arent on the right track they change your future and therefore your Path. You should never question them and always comply to their wishes. You have to stay true to the vows you made to the strict patriarchal doctrine of the land.  Its obvious from the beginning that Aislynns curious nature and big mouth are going to get her in trouble especially in combination with her wild uncontrollable magic. I liked how strong she was and how she accepts her change of life without too much complaining. The downside was that she fell bland to me. I never connected with Aislynn and honestly she is very boring. When you are taken from your Path I would expect emotions but I guess she has learned not to question them  The hints of magic never too much explored make me curious for the sequel. I want to see what Aislynn is capable of and how its going to help her after the confrontation at the end of this book. There was a lot of magical failure in the book probably to show us what a disappointment Aislynn is supposed to be but there are some lucky moments where she gets it right. I want her to break free to explore her limits.  There wasnt much romance unexpected for a fairytale retelling and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Granted there is something going on between characters but I didnt really care for it. It needs more time and a more prominent place in the story to become interesting. Its the same with the worldbuilding. Its good but it could have more structure. We are left with a lot of details that doesnt seem to come together. I also hope that the sequel provides more information about the Wicked Queen. The short mentions of her and the revelation at the end of Stray make me curious.  As I said the pacing is slow and the middle part is mostly about character development but I will give the sequel a try. It wasnt the best book ever but if you have some patience and a lot of love for fairytales like me I think you might appreciate what the authors is trying to achieve  but it needs work.;Elissa Sussman

Im a huge fan of everything that has to do with The Tudors so when I found this book with a paranormal twist I knew I had to read it and Im glad I did  The first thing I liked were the characters. Elizabeth is exactly how I imagine she would be. Deep down she is soft and hungry for love but she puts on a strong mask and she has the proud and arrogant way from her mother. I like how shes never truly bowing down to the will of her halfsister. Then there is our MC who embraces her gifts as a witch without hesitation. I thought she was a clever girl and I like how she refused Marcus no matter what. (That was one creepy guy)  While the plot is pretty basic and there arent many climaxes I had a great adventure with this book. I cant wait to see how the romance is going to develop and what will happen in the future.;Victoria Lamb

Monseas past has become shrouded in mystery and its only when Bitterblue begins sneaking out of her castle  curious disguised and alone  to walk the streets of her own city that she begins to realise the truth.

A very solid conclusion to a good series. Bitterblue wasnt my favorite character from the series but I liked how she developed and it was interesting to see the mystery reveal piece by piece.  Bitterblue rules after the death of her tyrant father Leck. She has a feeling that her advisers keep things from her and they only give her easy tasks to keep her busy. Instead of pleading for information Bitterblue takes things into her own hands. At night she leaves the castle dressed up as a kitchen maid in her castle. She meets the thieves Saf (who has an unknown Grace) and Teddy. Saf steals things Leck stole once so he can give it back to the rightful owner.  I liked Bitterblues spark. She can be a bit whiny about her situation but its hard for her to reclaim power after her fathers reign. Her advisers are lying to her and I like that she decides to get the information by going out on the street. It is dangerous for her so its a brave decision. Her character definitely develops in the story and you can see she grows into her role as queen.  We also get to see all the old characters. Katsa and Po visit her and tell her about the agitation in other Kingdoms. The people want to seize the power and put their own choice on the throne. Katsa and Po help them out with their rebel group. It was fun to see them together but I was surprised how weak Katsa seemed. She cried a lot and I dont think she did that very often in Graceling. Fire also makes a small entrance in the story and it was great to see everything tie together that way.  The plot was a little slower in this book but I didnt mind. The story needs time to set up and it gave Lecks madness more impact. The mystery around her advisers and what happened under her fathers hand was very interesting. I loved how we slowly unravel all the horrors and what is going on. It was a very effective way to show the broken kingdom Bitterblue must build up again. The mystery around her advisers and what happened under her fathers hand was very interesting. I loved how we slowly unravel all the horrors and what is going on.  I was a bit let down by the ending and the lack of romance (yes that is coming from me the girl who likes to have as little romance as possible). There is something going on with Bitterblue and Saf but we never get a real conclusion to their attraction. It almost feels like there could be another book that will follow them but overall Im very satisfied with the conclusion to this series (but Fire will always be my favorite part);Kristin Cashore Ian Schoenherr

What an impressive story I was immediately blown away by the historical accuracy of the story (as far as I can tell) and I loved reading about the real people at the end of the book. It appears that Anne did a lot of research and its noticeable throughout the story. From the moment the book started I was hooked to Gretchen and the story didnt let me go after that.  The Muller family are honored people because Gretchens father sacrificed his life for Hitler. This means that she grew up with uncle Dolf as one of his favorites. This doesnt prevent her brother Reinhard from punishing her for every mistake she makes. Gretchen is scared for him and when he beats her up one day she flees to a Jewish news reporter she is starting to be friends with. Daniel contacted her after finding a terrible discovery her father didnt sacrifice himself he was killed and then flung in front of Hitler. Together they try to unravel the truth despite the danger of finding out.  I admired Gretchen. Her mother always seem to favor her brother and he treats her so badly. It was not strange she was terrified of him. He had this cold plain evil way of looking at things. Emotionless and calculated those are the two words he has written all over his personality. He doesnt shy away from violence and Gretchen knows he is not afraid of hurting her. Despite everything she has courage and its brave how she handles situations. I liked that she was determined to find out the truth and how she was able to let Daniel in her life. Growing up with the biggest enemy of the Jews has imprinted her with Jewhate. It was realistic how she slowly changes the way she looks at them how she starts to see Daniel as human instead of Jew.  Daniel was great. Fierce and passionate to protect his people. It was good how he deals with Gretchen in the beginning. He understands that she hates him because she is taught too. He is able to see her good heart and it must have been hard to have patience but he let her change in her own pace. The growing friendship between them was adorable and so different from the normal relationships because of their different worlds. Their love story is almost like Romeo  Juliet without the tragic ending. It was perfect to make the story less depressing even when it didnt make me swoon.  Reading about Annes portrayal of Hitler is fascinating. Its almost impossible to think about him as a human because his maniac choices make him almost look like a monster. She managed to create a person who makes you understand that people where charmed by him and it still showed the madness that is lurking inside him. The whole story was just clever with a strong plot and a wonderful cast. The ending is satisfying tying everything that happened in this book while leaving excitement for the next book. I enjoyed this a lot and I cant wait to see more of this story.;Anne Blankman

Wow. I have a feeling I should have seen some of those twists coming but I didnt. Awesome I love it. I need more. This book broke my heart it made me melt and this is perfection. Feelings 3 review coming soon.(less)  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  You need this book in your life. If you havent read Throne of glass yet WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR I recently review the novellas for this series and I recommend reading these first to get to know Celaena. Throne of glass rocks and this is by far one of my favorite sequels. This book blew me away. With all the unexpected twists heartbreaking scenes and awesome characters this book earns his place in my all time favorite list. Im going to keep this review nonspoilery if you havent read any book because I want to persuade you to read this series. Its perfection.  Let me tell you honestly that Ive had a hard time writing down this review. My feelings are still all over the place and I cant seem to say goodbye yet. Im in desperate need of more so the wait might kill me.  1. Characters. After rereading Throne of glass and reading the novellas Im even more in love with Celaena. She is flawed but realistic and I like her different sides. Some people were disappointed by the lack of action in the first book but be prepared to meet the tough kickass assassin in action She makes dangerous plans behind the kings back but she doesnt even know how dangerous it is yet.. I liked to see the real killer in her and boy you dont want her to be angry with you It was fun unraveling more about her past and true identity. I also loved to see her vulnerability and how she doesnt simply forget Sam.  Hed love her enough to risk everything  to give up everything. Hed loved her so much that she still felt the echos of it even know.  There are also the two handsome awesome males. Dorian discovers a secret about himself. Something that can ruin his life forever and he needs to find a way to deal with it. He is on the background in this story but I still liked his presence. He plays an important part in Celaenas journey but it was a good decision to make one guy shine Chaol. There is so much Chaol time and this made my heart smile. I love this guy.  SPOILER  go to the blog to see this if you want.  Nehemia is the best friend were all looking far. She isnt afraid to stand up to Celaena. From the first book on these two have been soul mates and I loved reading about the time they spend together. SPOILER  go tot the blog to see this if you want.  The king. Sometimes there are villains who have good sides but this man is just pure evilness. He scared the crap out of me. He is ruthless and a maniac. I can understand that even Celaena is frightened for him and this is what the story needs. The tension he gives and the mystery around his part in the darkness  the question what he is up to  completes the cast.  There are also some other characters like the male courtesan Archer and Celaenas dog Fleetfoot. I like the distinctive voices and how everyone has a role in the story.  2. Worldbuilding. This was the only aspect that lacked in Throne of glass but wow Sarah made up for it here. We get to find out everything alongside Celaena and let me tell you its awesome. It was great to learn more about the Wyrdmarks and I never realized what they could do.  3. Plot. Wow. You guys this was unbelievable. Its filled with action very characterdriven sprinkled with romance and made up with heartbreaking twists. When I finished this book I had a feeling I should have seen it coming but I didnt. I was shocked and amazed by Sarahs genius plot. Every little piece of information comes together into this climax that was better than I could ever imagine. So clever.  4. Pacing and writingstyle. This book was a perfect mixture of these two aspects. Sarah has a great way with words and everything flows together. I wasnt even aware that I was reading. It was more like a movie in my head and I couldnt let go. The pace was even and enjoyable because of the good balance between action romance and mystery. There is no rushing but there is also no moment to get bored.  5. The ending. That is how you write an ending I wish every author was so gifted to end their story like this. Ive been reading some disappointing series ending lately but this is how I like to see them. It makes me anxious excited and inpatient for the next book but its also a good conclusion to the story in this book. That part has ended and were ready to continue.  If these things doesnt want to make you read the book I dont know what will do the trick. It has everything you could possibly look for in a YA fantasy and I definitely see this series becoming a classic like Harry Potter.;Sarah J. Maas

Such a cruel way to end your book Kagawa But credits for not frustrating me because I kind of liked it. It seems like Kagawa is someone who knows how to handle cliffhangers with grace.

A desperate person is ready to do anything  and Keirran wants to bargain everything to save the love of his life.  Review.  The first thing that surprised me is the fact that it took me a long time to get invested in the story. Kagawa normally knows how to hook me to her story but it had to grow on me. The first half feels like a setup for the true story which starts towards the ending. In the beginning its more talking than action. It wasnt bad but it made the story a bit slow. When the plot finally kicked in I remembered why I love her books. It was great to see Puck Grimalkin and a glimpse of Ash. These characters are still my favorites. The character in this book just seem to miss something.  I was surprised by how much I liked the romance. Im someone who prefers action but it was adorable. Kenzie and Ethans feelings are growing and it was cute to watch them together. I also liked Keirran and how he is willing to do everything for Annwyl. This was one of the first times I didnt mind how romancebased the plot was and it suited the story.  The ending is the way I like it.

I was completely blown away by this book Most authors fall for those cliche traps where they take a much used topic and dont manage to add something new to it. Not Susan Ee. This book changed the way I look at Angels and I love how she turned everything upside down. Its time to let go of every Angel image you have. Its time to meet the apocalypse Angels.  Penryns world is a scary place. She takes care of her wheelchairbound sister Paige who became cripple after a mysterious accident in her childhood. Their mother is a difficult woman who spends her days raving about demons and how they are coming for them  but that is the least of her problem. Their apocalyptic world is dominated by Angels and when one of them steals her sister Penryn is determined to get her back. She kidnaps a wounded Angel and forces him to take her to her sister. Raffe is not amused but it turns out they have a good team work.  The first sign that this book was going to be a hit for me was the writingstyle. From the moment I started Angelfall I was wrapped in the story. There is something very easy and flowy about her choice of worlds. Not to forget that its filled with details without being too much. I was there I saw and felt everything Penryn had to endure. It was amazing.  Another thing I adore were the characters more specific the dynamic between characters. Penryn is this normal girl with a badass attitude who will do everything to get her sister back. I like how realistic she was. She has flaws and she is not the best in everything but her love for her sister makes her a stronger version of herself. It was very clear in those couple of pages that she has a strong bond with Paige. There is also Raffe I love this sarcastic guy. He has to deal with a horrible loss and then he gets stuck with his annoying girl. Their banter is the best And by now you might know that this is one of my favorite type of romances. From the moment she laid eyes on him I just knew I wanted them to be together.  You are nothing but a bird with attitude. Okay so you have a few muscles Ill grant you that. But you know a bird is nothing but a barely evolved lizard. Thats what you are.  The last thing I want to address is the original use of the Angels and the gory scenes. I admire how Susan created something unique and her version of Angels is my favorite (and scariest) type. These super developed flying humans with incredible strength quick healing and merciless personalities are terrifying. The things they do with human children give some frightening bloody scenes which I absolutely loved The ending was nicely done. She wrapped up most of this story but leave a lot of space for the next book. I cant wait to start World after;Susan Ee

Because Deanna has a secret  and somebody knows. Someone who is out to get Hyde. And if she doesnt play along and help the enemy destroy him...she will be sold to the highest bidder in the black market for human swans.Now Deanna is struggling to break free from the gilded cage that would trap her forever...Feather Bound is a dark debut reminiscent of Gabriel Garcia Marquezs A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings and the twisted truth behind the fairy tale of Cinderella.;304;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1380828008m17829175.jpg;Feather Bound;fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book is bizarre unique and so different from what I expected. Im still not sure if thats a good or a bad sign but it was not how I imagined this book would be. It was supposed to be a Cinderella retelling. I could see some elements but retelling is a big word in this book. I would prefer to call it subtly inspired and it reminded me more of mythology (Selkie) and the swan princess.  Deanna is the hard working sister who tries to take care of her family. Her mother died years ago her father is a alcoholic one of her sisters is married and the other likes to spend her money on herself. The MC felt a bit like a Mary Sue to me. I cant be bothered by it in a fairy tale but I was hoping to get more in this book. There was room enough to make her a better developed character. That doesnt take away that she wasnt a bad character. She was brave and strong.  When Deanna and her family attend a funeral from her fathers old friend she finds out that her friend from the past isnt dead. Hyde has been gone for 9 years and he is back to claim his fathers company. Deanna is hurt and confused. I like how she turns away from him because she feels betrayed. Hyde has a hard time and he takes a lot of effort to talk to Deanna but she refuses him and it felt very realistic to me. I wasnt sure what to think about him though. He keeps a lot of secrets and that made it hard to connect with him. I never had the feeling I knew him.  Deannas life is turned upside down when one day her back cracks open like an egg and feathers appear she is a swan. The first time I was introduced to a swan I thought everyone was going to freak out but apparently everyone is aware that there are swanlike humans in the society. Being a swan makes you vulnerable. When you take away their feather cape they are yours and must obey all your wishes. So when Anton  Hydes enemy cousin  finds out that Deanna is a swan he uses that information to manipulate her. He wants her to destroy Hyde because he wants revenge for stealing his business and for putting his father in jail.  Deanna is torn between her freedom and Hyde especially when her old feelings are returning when they start to date. I already predicted what was going to happen and I was aware of Hydes secret but that didnt take away that I liked the plot. I thought it was interesting to see these swans and how people use them for their own pleasure. Sarah doesnt shy away from the gruesome fact that swans are raped and abused. I liked how she included a fairy tale to show that fact and overall it was a story Ive never read before so credits for the creativity.;Sarah Raughley

Nope.  Nope.  I cant do it. 58 pages and I hate everything about it.  First off the writingstyle. I love it when someone tells me a story but this was just one big mess. There were parts in it that made it looks like the book needs more editing. I also dont like the amount of fucks that are thrown around.  Shit what the fuck am I even doing What kind of history book doesnt even have a map Once upon a time there was a writer who couldnt write a fucking book. I dont know what comes next. That whole chapters going to need to get thrown out anyway. You completely forgot halfway through that youd said it was raining at the beginning.  Was it raining  No ones ever going to know and its all your fault.  Put a fucking map in the next draft.  It doesnt add anything to the book for me and it only distracted me from the already confusing plot. What I gathered is that there is a war between gnomes and fairies  and there is something called tightropers that try to help the fairies. In the mean time fairies disappeared and are eaten by gnomes. Beckan is one of the main characters and she has a jar with her fathers eye ear and tooth in it and apparently he is still alive. As a good daughter she brings the jar of body parts everywhere with her.  She is also a prostitute for the enemy together with her boy friends. She fucks the guy who brought her fathers remains to her after they were done eating him. And how nice that he pays her extra so he can fuck her twice. He slips money in her pocket before he slides it off. How romantic.  Then the war is suddenly over but later its not and what on earth am I reading So I decided its just best to say goodbye and to cross this author of my list (because I also disliked her previous book Teeth)  Goodbye interesting promise.  Goodbye characters that can die for all I care.  Goodbye confusing worldbuilding.  And most of all goodbye messed up writingstyle.;Hannah Moskowitz

Im not a huge fan of Aliens but I always like to try new things and this sounded interesting. I really want to read the sequel to this book because Derting managed to end it exactly how I like it most of the story from this book is wrapped up and there is a big revealing that makes me anxious for more. That being said this book wasnt without flaws.  Kyra disappeared five years ago after a fight with her father but when she returns she believes she was gone for one day. She woke up behind a store and from that moment her whole life is different. She has no memory of what happened those five years but things have changed a lot. Her parents broke up her mother is newly married and has a son her father has gone mad with Alien  and abduction theories. Her boyfriend moved on with her best friend and they are living the life she imagined. In the mean time Tyler has grown up to be a man instead of her (ex) boyfriends little brother.  I liked how realistic Kyras reactions felt. I was sad for her and the old life she lost. She has a huge gap in her memory and the life she knew is gone. I felt her frustrations and I understood how hard it was to adapt to these new situations. Stories about memory loss are always fascinating to me and scary at the same time. I would go crazy in Kyras situation so I admired her strength. She was a little naive sometimes and she easily trusts people but I think those flaws made her a believable character. The only thing I didnt like about her personality was how selfcentred she seemed and how she treats her family. Yes her mother felt cold and distanced but it must be hard to get your daughter back after moving on. Kyra is giving her a hard time by sneaking out and disappearing when she feels like it. Her father is loving but his theories and divorce havent been good on him. She could have showed more patience for him.  The romance was one of harder things to connect with. I adored Tyler but just thinking about their past made me a little uncomfortable. It was sweet to see how he tries to support Kyra and he was a true friend but I wasnt sure how I felt about him as loveinterest. It also went far too fast. Just because they knew each other doesnt mean that such feelings develop so quickly. She often refers to him as the little brother in her mind.  It was good how Derting first set the basics of this story (Kyras return dealing with the situation and starting to get feelings for Tyler) before the true plot kicks in although it made the story sometimes a little slow. It appears that Kyras father isnt as crazy as everyone is saying. There is a whole organization looking for Kyra and there are more people like her who call themselves the Returned. Simon is one of them and he is trying to protect her. Im very curious about this organization and why people are abducted  and why some return. This story was definitely a setup for more and because of that ending I cant wait to read all about it in the sequel.;Kimberly Derting

Im not a huge fan of anthologies but this one features fairy tales and I thought you cant go wrong with that. Obviously you can.. There were more stories I enjoyed than hated but most of them were just enjoyable with the potential of being great. Im going to point out the highlights and the ones I dislike because reviewing them all would make this review too long.  Good stories  Sleeping beauty of Elista.  The blend of the original tale with the modern world was subtle. It didnt clashed with the charm of a fairy tale but it created something original. Its about vaccinations and how one girl ended up in a neverending sleep.  Lupine.  This book is how a fairy tale is supposed to be. It already starts with a great fairytalish line. Its about a bad mother and a lovely girl who needs to find herself to break free.  The spinning wheels tale.  Very interesting POV It gives a complete other spin to the Sleeping beauty tale.  Warrior dreams.  I liked that this story was based on sacrifice. Its not about romance and finding your true love but its about sacrificing your life to protect others.  Castle of masks.  This is by far my favorite story. It vaguely reminds me of Beauty and the beast (and I swear its not because of that) Its wellwritten and clever. Its about a boy who sacrifices himself to the beast by dressing up as a girl. He wants to find revenge for his sister who went the year before but instead of a monster he finds a friend. A friend he still needs to kill.. I didnt saw the twist coming.  Blanchefleur.  I always like tales where the hero is portrayed like a total loser. The boy here is called Idiot but people are not able to see his potential. I loved seeing him develop into the boy he truly is.  Bad stories  The lenten rose.  This is a retelling of The snow queen but it was just so slow and boring. I never felt engaged in the story and there was something off about the writingstyle. Its a shame because this was one of the longer retellings.  Tales that fairies tell.  I have no idea what this story is about because I skipped it. From the first page I knew this wasnt going to work for me. I believe its supposed to be about Puss in boots who tells a story and its a strange blend with chicklit.  The road of needles.  Weird story. I started to skim and I still dont know what this was supposed to be.. Something with red riding hood but it was weird.  The hush of feathers.  I like the idea of the author but it didnt work for me. I felt unsatisfied at the end and it was hard to get into the story.  The mirror tells all.  I guess it was the POV but I also had troubles with the writingstyle. It felt a bit choppy.  Overall not bad. Still not good enough to give it 3 stars but if you are a hardcore fairytale fan like me its definitely interesting enough to read it once otherwise skip it.;Paula Guran Theodora Goss Caitlin R.

It was a rollercoaster of feelings. I was frightened disgusted terrified and happy all at the same time. Im sad to say goodbye to this stories and the characters Ive grown to love but Kagawa did it again. A fantastic ending to one of the best vampire series Ive ever read. It was hard finding the right words to do this story justice but I hope I can convince you to read this series if you havent read the first book yet. This review is therefor completely spoilerfree.  There are often authors who excel in one aspect of writing but Kagawa manages to nail them all.  Worldbuilding.  From the moment I started this series I loved the idea of this apocalyptic world where vampires rule over humans in cities and where our kind is plagued by a Red Lung virus and rabids. I never thought the situation could be any more worse but thats exactly what happens here. The maniac Sarren wants to use a mutated virus to clean the earth from every inhabitant. The rabids he uses are TERRIFYING. Kagawa has her way with words and its gross. Detailed bloody and horrible I loved it. There are multiple fighting scenes and they definitely made my heart pump faster.  Writingstyle.  Like a movie. I was swept away in the story and the emotions of our cast. I was completely sucked into the story which made some situations quite tense. Like I said in the intro I went through a rollercoaster of feelings. Kagawa is a master in playing with your feelings and she knows how to paint a picture. Which is in this case quite a grim scary place.  Characters.  Oh isnt that sweet came Jackals loud mocking voice before I could reply. Lets make googoo eyes at each other in the middle of a stinking corpse field how every romantic. Ignoring my glare he kicked an arm out of his way and sauntered forward the ax vanishing beneath his duster one more.  [GIF]  First of all JACKAL. If Klaus and Damon from Vampire Diaries could get a child it would be Jackal. This guy stole my heart with his sarcasm and blunt way of thinking. He has embraced his monster part but I like the glimpses of good. His banters with his blood sister Allie were the best. I chuckled through their dialogues. I liked how unpredictable he is and he lightens every situation with his humor  and sometimes surprisingly smart remarks.  [GIF]  Allie our tragic heroin who has to deal with the loss of her love Ezekiel (Zeke). She is incredibly confused in the beginning and she is starting to lose her sanity. I thought it was a realistic portrayal of her personality. The somewhat weakness in these moments made me admire her strength even more. It bordered on the line of whiny but I tried to remember that she is only a new vampire. Its not strange that her feelings are a mess. She is still a bit reckless but her heart is in the right place and I like determined characters.  [GIF]  Attractive strong Kanin. The master vampire who is disappointed with Jackal but who has high hopes for Allie. I like how he is always silent brooding and mysterious but at the same time deadly and powerful. His calming presence was a great addition to the story and he completed this trio in their quest to avenge and stop Sarren.  [GIF]  Who is an absolute freak. He must be one of the scariest and most mental disturbed characters Ive ever read about. His actions show that he has no mercy and he is so convinced that is right. He leaves a path of destruction behind him when he is on his way to destroy the whole world. Kagawa still manages to make him a realistic character instead of a caricature. The fact that he believes that he is making the world better makes him even creepier. His darkness combined with the already bleak situation made this book one hell of a ride.  There are some heartbreaking situations and some surprising twists so what are you waiting for;Julie Kagawa

That was great Review will follow )  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Ive had this book on my wish list for a long time. I read The Near Witch years ago and I enjoyed her writingstyle and characters. Im really happy Aditi gave it to me.  This book shines because of its brilliant concept. When someone dies their body returns to the Archive where Librarians can read their memories. Mackenzies grandfather was a Keeper and he made her his heir against everyones expectations. A Keeper is a person who returns Histories bodies that woke up. There is also a Crew that has to kill a History if it manages to escape the place between the Archive and our world.  Mackenzie recently moved with her parents and she is assigned to a new spot where its crowded. She is thrown into some dangerous situations. Victoria doesnt spare our main character from some beatings but luckily she gets help from the boy in her building Wesley. From the moment Mac meets him I was ready for the ship. They have this chemistry between them and I love Wesleys personality. He is that type of laidback person that can charm everyone with his easy talk. Not to forget the fact that he reminded me of Captain Hook from Once upon a time because our lovely Wesley wears eyeliner.  It was nice to see Mackenzie growing up through flashbacks. I liked her right away. Her nononsense way of thinking the way she tried to deal with her grief and her parents sadness the situation in her district she got to me. I liked her pride and strength but also her vulnerability around Wesley. The introduction of a somewhat lovetriangle made me cringe a little but at the same time I get where her feelings came from.  The Archive sounds like an interesting place. You have to be quiet (you dont want to wake up any Histories do you) and Macs visits are actually prohibited. One of her friend Librarian Roland is permitting her entrance and I liked their relationship. Its clear he cares for her and I like that he always trusted her despite her young age.  The plot in this book is based on a mystery behind the Histories and why they keep waking up. I actually saw most of it coming but some twists were still cleverly found. Overall a fantastic story with a good writingstyle that made me want more.;Victoria Schwab

I changed the rating to 5 stars. The ending still manages to shock me.    httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I enjoyed this book much more than the previous book. The bone season felt a bit overwhelming with the informationdumps in the beginning but I had no problems with The mime order. The details are spread throughout the story and instead of being lost I felt wrapped inside this world and its characters.  Matters of the heart are quite beyond me. Hearts are frivolous things good for nothing but pickling.  Jaxon.  This book is an exciting journey. Paige managed to escape from Sheol I with other fugitives making them the mostwanted people in London. Scion is looking for them and to keep herself covered Paige has to return to work for her old mime lord Jaxon. I like how Paige tried to standup for herself and the truth around the danger of the Rephraite. She wasnt ready to bow to Jaxon and I found it admirable. Her life becomes even more complicated when the Underlord and his gang are murdered the battle for the new Underlord is about to begin.  What I love about the plot is the complexity but how is refrains from becoming too dense. The political intrigue behind the Underlord and the brutal fight at the ending were exactly what I needed. That scene made my heart pound and Samantha doesnt spare her characters so I had some frightened moments there. The twist at the end made my mouth drop and I wish the next book was already there because its going to be hard to wait.  I liked how we got more details about voyants and what happened how the Rephraite came into the world and gained power. I think Im going to have to reread The bone season because like I said in the introduction the worldbuilding overwhelmed me in the beginning. I felt there was a better balance in The mime order and I want to go back to explore it again.  Paige was a very strong character. She is realistic and intelligent although sometimes a bit rash in her decisions. I warmed up for her and felt more connected to her than in The bone season. I had the same with Warden and their scenes together were great. Their romance is on the background and that gives a perfect vibe in the story. There is a tension between them and you are ready for it to explode. The secondary characters are also fleshed out like Jaxon and his obsession with becoming the new Underlord for power and money.  There is only one thing left to say I WANT MORE.;Samantha Shannon

But to save Reev Kai must unravel the threads of her past and face shocking truths about her brother her friendship with Avan and her unique power.;335;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1399567616m17904985.jpg;Gates of Thread and Stone (Gates of Thread and Stone 1);fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I liked it. I didnt fall in love with it the way I thought I would but its a very solid story that promise something good for the sequels.  Kais brother Reev disappears and she is willing to do anything to get him back even if that means she has to look for the Black Rider a feared and mysterious man. Together with her youth friend Avan a guy she secretly fancies she hunts him down and he has to face some shocking truths about herself.  I liked the writingstyle. Its fastpaced and it made me feel connected with the story. It didnt take much time before I finished the book and that also has to do with the interesting plot. Kai has a special ability she can manipulate the threads of time. Nobody can know she is capable of doing so because she would be hunted down and put to death. Her gift is quite interesting because she can slow time down in dangerous situations.  There is only person who knows about her power and that is her brother Reev who found her when she was a baby. I love how the author showed that you dont have to share blood to be family. Reev and Kai are close and their relationship was one of the highlights of this story. Its obvious they are willing to do anything to keep each other save and that can be tough. They live in one of the poor parts of the city which is made out of trash in the shape of a labyrinth.  Its understandable that Kai doesnt hesitate for one moment when her brother doesnt return home. Without second thoughts she makes up her mind about finding him no matter the cost. Such loyalty always makes me admire a character and Kai is an easy character to appreciate. She is clever and strong. Nobody can stop her and I liked her insecurity when it comes to Avan although I wasnt a complete fan of him. There was something about him that prevented me from completely liking him. He is supportive of her and the fact he stays with her no matter how dangerous the situation is made him acceptable.  The story took an interesting turn towards the ending. Her time with the Black Rider and the way we are presented with information about her brothers disappearing is nicely done. The book gets a mythological touch and that worked really well. I cant wait to see what this will mean for the sequel;Lori M. Lee

What a charming cute story This is definitely a book I see myself reading for my future child(ren). Its adventurous magical and exciting. Ive settled with a 3.5 rating but I would have adored this book when I was younger  This is the story of Ophelia a girl who believes things if they are scientifically proven. So when her father takes a new job at a museum she never expects something magical to happen. Until she stumbles on the Marvelous boy who is locked away in one of the many rooms. He tells her his story about how wizards took his name and prepared him to defeat the Snow Queen. How Ophelia must help him to break free before it is too late because the Snow Queen is planning to take over.  I love how clever and stubborn Ophelia is. At first she is not willing to believe the boy. How are all these things possible There is no such thing as magic right Her reactions felt very realistic and it was fun to see her change. She is letting go of her analytic thinking and she is letting magic into her life. The voice of her recent passed away mother guides Ophelia through her journey in the museum. She must finds several keys to release the boy and this brings her into some interesting situations. I liked how Karen incorporated the story of the Marvelous Boy. Every time Ophelia visits him he tells her another part of his life. Their friendship is heartwarming.  Its very obvious who the Snow Queen is but the predictability added to the charm. There wasnt a moment I was hoping on a twist because thats not what this story needs. Its just a tale of two children who are both lonely in their own way. Its a story about friendship and finding courage sprinkled with some magic. This book contains messages Id like to give to my child(ren) and I definitely recommend this to fathersmothers to read as bedtime story. Its also enjoyable enough for us grownups;Karen Foxlee

I was captured by the fantastic story and characters. The story takes some time to really kick in so some might call it slow paced but I think it was just right. This is my first troll book and Danielle assured that it wont be my last one  and if you like magic a sweet romance and a rebellion I think youll say the same.  Summary  Cecile is kidnapped and sold to the trolls who are captured under the mountains by a witchs curse. They believe Cecile is the one from the prophecy the girl who is going to break the curse. She is bound to Tristan prince of Trollus and now its time for her to wait for the best opportunity to escape. Until they start to fall in love with each other. Perhaps it is her call to free the trolls after all.. Cecile is starting to find her place in Trollus and she even discovers new things about herself.  Review  The writingstyle was superb. I was transported to the world of Trollus and I walked sidebyside with Cecile. The setting was magical and I was sucked into the story which has a very interesting and complex plot without being overwhelming. I liked the story behind the curse and the witch who cast it on Trollus.  Cecile is now an important piece for the King who is a madman and one of the most powerful trolls. He wants to break the curse in order to increase his empire. This gives a lot of tension in Trollus because there are rebels who want to overthrow the king. There is also magic and explanations how it exactly works. Danielle makes sure that everything has enough background information  without info dump  to make it plausible.  Im also happy to announce that these things play the main role in the story because the romance is there to add something extra to the story sweetness Cecile and Tristan cant stand each other. She is forced to leave her whole world behind to marry an arrogant troll who seems to be the same as every other troll he despises humans. I loved their amusing conversations and its clear from the beginning that there is chemistry between them. It takes some time for both of them to figure that out. They are cute together and the I love yous didnt bother me so much  I felt the timing was good enough to handle that. They spend enough time to get to know each other and this comes from someone who prefers to have aslessromanceaspossible.  Ha ha Tristan snorted. How dreadfully clever. And speaking of clever is this to be your bid for escape He contemplated my clothing. In a dressing gown and bare feet Now tell me if I go put on nightclothes and slippers might I join you or is this a solo adventure  Cecile is a wonderful character. She is believable because she has different aspects. She is strong and intelligent but she is also sad and angry. There are moments where she loses some of her control and says hurtful things that she regrets later. She makes some stupid decisions but she also knows how to trick others by being clever. It was fun being around her. Then there is Tristan the troll who is doomed to be heir. I immediately liked him and his sarcastic humor. I appreciate what he does to protect his people and he would be a good leader. He is so protective over Cecile its adorable (but not in the way most guys are. He is aware that Cecile is able to stand up for herself too)  The ending is just plain cruel It fits the story and it wasnt a frustrating openending but I definitely could use the second book right now If you look for a fantasy with a solid worldbuilding adorable romance and interesting characters Stolen Songbird is the book for you;Danielle L.

Its not one of my favorite fairytale retellings but its definitely a good story. I liked what Rhiannon did with the story. She managed to take Sleeping Beauty and turn it into something new. The realistic approach to the tale gave it an interesting twist.    When Aurora awakes she is immediately thrown into a new life shes not ready for. While she is trying to deal with the fact that the world lived on Aurora is used as pawn in a political plan. I could feel her confusion and unsettling feeling which shows that Rhiannon has a great writingstyle. I flew through the pages but I never found myself completely hooked to the story. The plot was a bit slow every now and then and I missed something but I cant point out what.  I like that this book was characterdriven because Aurora was a good character to be around. With the blink of an eye Auroras whole life is turned upside down and her reactions felt very real to me. I loved how she tried to fight against her marriage with a complete stranger. Just because he woke her up and is supposed to be her true love because a story says so doesnt mean Aurora feels the same way. It was a great change in storyline and better than the sappy loveatfirstkiss like the original tale. Aurora stands up for herself and tries to get a grip on her life but its hard to change decisions made outside your power.  The other characters are less fleshed out. I disliked her true love without a real reason. He is not a bad guy but he has no spine and he knows he is being used by his parents but he let it happen. I dont care for those type of characters but at the same time it was a nice contrast with Aurora. Its good that the damselindistress part was changed by making the prince weak.  The background story of Sleeping beauty was nicely done. Its great how Rhiannon combined original aspects with her own twists. Let me just say that the Witch is going to play a big role in Auroras life. I also liked how we get the information about what happened while Aurora was asleep. There were no information dumps and we still get the whole picture.  The thing that annoyed me was the ending. I was expecting a standalone but the ending is so unresolved and now its clear this is the first book in a series. I would like to read more about Aurora  its just disappointing that I wasnt aware of that fact. It made the ending feel abrupt and it came out of nowhere. Nevertheless I look forward to it.;Rhiannon Thomas

The first time I read Daughter of smoke and bone I gave it 3.5 flowers. I had trouble with the beginning of the book and I wasnt blown away. When I bought the sequels I decided to reread the book and I was surprised I liked it so much more I was sucked into the story right away. For some reason the story worked better the second time so I ended up giving it 4 flowers now.  The sequels continued to stun me. Laini has a way with words and its easy to get lost inside her tale. She spins a story in front of you and before you know it you are hooked inside it. The story grows dark in Days of blood and starlight and continues to be more gruesome in Dreams of Gods and Monsters. I absolutely loved it and I like how she managed to make the books enjoyable instead of being too dark or depressing. Her worldbuilding is excellent. Laini found the perfect balance there is enough details to make it vivid but not so much that there are infodumps.  Daughter of smoke and bone could be seen as a very good setup because thats when we learn about Karous background. It was interesting to find out what was going on and who she really is. Her friendship with Zuzana was adorable and its good to see that the girl plays a constant important role in her life. She isnt swept away when the plot kicks in. Laini managed to write her into the story in a subtle way making sure she is there when Karou needs her the most.  The romance between Akiva and Karou had a touch of instalove but its quite understandable when you know the whole story. However it wasnt my favorite aspect of the story. I loved Karou and her feisty intelligent personality. I wasnt a huge fan of Akiva for some reason. He always felt a little flat to me and I didnt feel connected to him. I did warm up to him in the sequel  my favorite part of the series. Days of blood and starlight was amazing and I had to give it 5 flowers. Karou takes an important role in the upcoming war between the two different camps. We get to see glimpses of Karous past and are introduced to new characters like the White Wolf Ziri and the nasty Jael. Ziri was adorable and stole my heart right away. Jael was creepy and provides an interesting bad guy.  The war breaks loose in Dreams of Gods and monsters. Its a battle with many consequences and its fascinating to see how old enemies unite against a common enemy. There is also a new problem coming up someone is hunting down Akiva. All these threats make the story intense and fastpaced. I was constantly turning pages wanting more. The other two books ended with crazy cliffhangers but this book has a spectacular perfect ending. I couldnt have wished for more.  Laini has found her way to my list of favorite authors and I look forward to her new books.;Laini Taylor

I think everyone is familiar with this concept by now. This book is recently adapted as movie with Matt Damon. The story is about Marc and how he strands on Mars after a failed mission. His crew believes he is dead and manage to go on their way back to Earth but Marc is not dead at all. It is up to his intelligence and education to survive long enough so that they can save him. That means he has to find a way to grow enough food which is right up his sleeve as biologist and he has to find a way to communicate with Earth.  This book has a lot of glowing reviews and I have seen many blogging friends rave about the story. Normally I would not have picked this up but I went in and came out disappointed. This book is definitely wellresearched there is no denying that. It is obvious that Weir knows what he is talking about and I was blown away by Marcs intelligence and humor under his difficult circumstances. The thing is I dont care about math and if I read a book I dont want to have a feeling Im reading a manual. This felt more like a how to survive on Mars guide then a fictional story. I was bored and really struggled at times but in the end I was satisfied that Ive finished it.  I also watched the movie and I think the concept worked better on the screen. They skipped all the explanations which made the story much faster.    Well..  That wasnt what I expected after all the high ratings and raving.  I thought it would be emotional.  I thought it would be exciting and filled with tension. It was okay at some points but..  I was bored and it felt like I was reading a manual 90 of the time.  Review will follow.;Andy Weir

He would go back and he would kill the witch. Because there was no way out of this save one death. Hers.. or his.  This book has so much potential but it just didnt live up to it. I was expecting magic witches and action. Instead I got a romance without chemistry and the biggest assholes Ive read about so far. Rosa wasnt strong enough to make this book successful and Luke was only okay. Shame.    httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This is another example of a good premise gone wrong. This book had everything it promises witches and magic And look at the pretty cover Well you are wrong. I am disappointed and frankly deceived by the blurb.  The first thing where everything goes wrong is the fact that I couldnt connect with the characters. On one side we have Luke who is facing his final test before he can enter the Malleus Maleficorum brotherhood. He wants to take revenge on the witch who killed his mother and father. His task is to kill Rosa Greenwood the girl he picked from the Book of Witches. Rosa is terrorized by her family. Her brother is an asshole her mother is a greedy bitch and her loveinterest is an even bigger ass. Sorry but I had to get that out of my system. This didnt make the book any more enjoyable. It has been a while since Ive hated a character as much as I hated Sebastian. Warning If you dont like animal cruelty you better stay away. He beats a puppy to death without any reason.  Rosa is forced to marry Sebastian because they are in need of money and he comes from a rich family. The fact that Rosa endures everything without complaining or using her magic shows that she has no backbone at all. I just couldnt feel sorry for her and I wanted her to be brave and standup for herself. Instead she backs away to revel in self pity. There are countless of times I wished that Luke just stabbed her but of course he starts to doubt his motives. When Rosa finally is in a state of dying he rescues her and seals his fate.  Another thing is the lack of chemistry. These characters have nothing in common and there is zero spark between them. They could have been brother and sister for all that matters. The whole romance slams into your face with only one purpose to have romance. I kept asking myself WHERE IS THE MAGIC WHERE ARE THE WITCHES And all I got was a mess with a predictable plot. Im happy that the ending is fairly conclusive because now I dont have to read the sequel.;Ruth Warburton

The moment I started this book I knew I was up to something good. This was one of the best beginnings Ive read in a long time. The writingstyle is gorgeous and I was immediately curious about the mystery around the juvenile detention center and Orianna. This is a story about guilt lies and dealing with a situation thats not in your control. Through the eyes of two girls Amber and Violet we get to know the story behind Oris conviction.  The first chapter starts with Ambers point of view. She is locked away in the detention center after an accusation everybody believes is false. Ori becomes her new roommate and the two create a special bond. There is something about Ori and everything she does shows that she doesnt belong there. She is one of them but at the same time she isnt.  I liked Amber and it was fascinating to see the center through her eyes. It sounds like a horrible place filled with girls with different sentences according to their crime. Amber did feel a little distant but that seemed to match with the overall feeling in the book. I liked Ori the best. She seemed like a very sweet girl who wants to see the best of everything. Her mystery kept making me turn the pages to find out what happened.  Then we switch and get to know Violet a ballerina dancer whose life is filled with lies and guilt for the death of her friend Ori. Violet is happy she can escape from her little town to go to college but she isnt ready until she visits the place where the juvenile center was. Slowly we unravel what happened and how Ori ended up locked away while she had such a promising future. Violet isnt written as a likable character but Nova did a great job with portraying her and making her interesting enough to follow.  The paranormal approach was a nice touch to the story but also felt underdeveloped. This made the ending a bit underwhelming but at the same time I like how it all wraps together. The truth that comes out and the way everything is solved is satisfying. This is my first book from this author and definitely not my last one.;Nova Ren Suma

Im still blown away by this book. I must admit that the middle part started to drag a little but what an ending I loved the action when they are in Everneath and I appreciate the fact that Ashton went to certain places with her story. Its great when an author surprises you despite the fact that it is bittersweet and heartbreaking. I couldnt have asked for a better ending.  But I would be lying if I say that this didnt happen  This heart is yours. It belongs to you. It beats only for you. And somewhere out there is a heart without a home and it beats for me and were not giving up until we find it. Page 126 from ARC.  This is a series I would recommend to other people without hesitation. It has everything you can wish for. Gorgeous covers wellwritten story great characters and a perfect ending. Im so happy that Ashton managed to deliver with this story. I was desperate for a story with an ending that lives up to my expectations.  Be aware that there are spoilers for the other books. You can read the review if you have read the previous books because there are no spoilers for this one.  This story continues right where Everbound ended. Ashton subtle reminds us what happened in the previous book so a reread isnt necessarily. Cole tricked Nikki and she is desperately trying to come up with a plan to destroy the Everneath. Jack will do anything to keep her alive and is always by her side. I love how this book showed their individual personalities more. I always liked Jack but I appreciated him even more because he finally claims his role. Their chemistry is great but sometimes it was a bit too much for me. This is completely personal since Im not such a fan of a strong romantic focus.  But I will destroy the Everneath before I feed on another human being. And I will destroy anything or anyone that stand in my way. Page 1 from ARC.  Ive been a fan of Nikki from the beginning. She is strong and I admire her spirit. I dont think I could sacrifice myself like she would. Its great how determined she is and how she keeps distrusting Cole. Talking about him what a brilliant move from Ashton. She used a surprising twist on him We also get the chance to understand him and his motives even more.  Like I said earlier the middle part started to drag a little. Jack and Nikki are trying to figure out a way to destroy Everneath and in the mean time they try to figure out Cole. Just when I needed more Ashton kicked up the pace and the action. The time they spend in Everneath was exciting and filled with tension. I loved it The ending was a rollercoaster of feelings but it could not have been more perfect. Much credits for Ashton and I look forward to more of her books. She deserves her spot on my favorite author list.  Give me your heart I said.  He tilted his head leaned forward watching my eyes the entire time to make sure it was okay and kissed me lightly on the lips. You already have it. Page 349 from ARC.;Brodi Ashton

It must have been so frustrating for women to feel so unappreciated. Its amazing how they kept fighting for their voice and place in life. Vickys constant fight for her own future and dreams tugged at my heart and I admired her strength.  EDIT  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  This book came highly recommended by one of my friends and book club members Debby so I was thrilled when I got a copy from Daisy last December. I always like historical fiction (and I dont read enough of them) and look at that pretty cover. This book didnt disappoint with all its women power.  This book is pretty much everything I look for in a historical fiction. Sharon manages to create a setting that felt very authentic to me. Her descriptions made it easy to get swept away to a time period where women had no rights and their only prospects was getting children and taking care of the household. Every ambitious dream was immediately suppressed with the idea that their only talent should be obedience to their husband. Her writingstyle seemed to capture the essence really well and I felt the frustration from Victoria and the WSPU (suffragette movement).  But the best part for me was our main character. Victoria also known was Vicky has one goal and thats becoming an artist. When word leaks out that she posed nude in front of her art class Vicky is send home with a scandal. Her father has only one way to deal with the situation and that is marrying her off to the only guy who still shows interest in her. Lets not talk about the fact that this guy has the personality of a paper sheet and the spine of an earthworm all wrapped inside a gorgeous body and handsome face. I disliked everything he represented. Vicky is not enamoured by him but more by the idea of the freedom he could give her during their marriage.  I was really charmed by Vicky and I love how she stood up for the life she wants. Vicky is strong stubborn and intelligent. No matter how many times she gets told shell never be an artist she isnt going to back down. The way she fights for her dream is admirable and I also liked her clever tricks that will ensure a future at the University. Her struggle between the life she has and the life she want was nicely portrayed. This especially showed when she becomes more involved in the WSPU where women do everything to gain their own rights. Her passion for art made me appreciate paintings more. The author had a fantastic way to show how it must feel like to create something beautiful.  The secondary characters we meet here were fleshed out and I instantly liked Lucy and her blunt way of speaking.  This book subtly touches some romance and I was shipping it so hard. Im almost at a point where Im going to say I wanted more. Its slowburn and it all started out with hate that slowly turned into appreciation friendship and more. The forbidden aspect about their love made it even cuter and I dont think anyone can dislike policeman Will. He showed respect and he had his own ways to support the demonstrating women. My heart instantly warmed to him and his soft personality.  The ending left me with a very satisfying goofy smile. This is an author Im going to keep an eye on.;Sharon Biggs Waller

This story has a beautiful setting and interesting concept. I know from her previous work like Sister Red and Sweetly that the author knows how to write an engaging story. But despite the well crafted worldbuilding I wasnt fully invested in the story and the problem lies with the main character Natalya.  That wasnt foolish Natalya. That was love. Love hopes for happy endings.  Natalya is in love with Alexei Romanov next in line to be ruler of Russia. It seems that they have a long history together and that is why he trusts her with a dangerous secret. Before he died Rasputin poured his magic into a Faberge egg. This egg ensures their hold on Russia and their health. Until the egg is stolen in the middle of a riot from the Reds. They are tired of their bad treatment and poverty so the royal family is captured and Natalya is in desperate need to find the egg. But she isnt the only one. Leo believes that he is capable of changing the owner of the egg in the hope to help his people. He kidnaps Natalya and her best friend Emilia and they travel to Moscow.  The worldbuilding was great. It felt like I was walking besides Natalya and I felt the tension when she sees her beloved city fall into the hands of the Reds. The setting was interesting too. The story behind the Romanov family and the questions about the survival of Anastasia are well incorporated. Its obvious that the author did her research on the matter which made it all feel more realistic.  Natalya started out as a promising character. It wasnt hard to imagine her sadness when she discovers that Alexei is hold captive and her desperation to find the one thing that might save him and his family. The only thing is I couldnt connect with her. I wished I liked her more but her sudden romance with Leo messed everything up. I just cant understand how she fell in love so fast especially not in that situation. It almost felt like a betrayal of her love with Alexei.  Despite that I quite liked Leo. He represented the other side of the story. He shows Natalya the reason behind their rebellion and he always came across as a good person. His character gave balance to the story and I like how it changed Natalya and her look on things. He has his reasons to find the egg  an aspect that surprised me. I never thought there would be such a focus on magic.  Overall a good book but it wasnt mindblowing.;J. Nelle Patrick Jackson Pearce

I was so disappointed by this book. It had all the potential to be a very good story inspired by the Arabian nights. Instead I was thrown into a horrible lovetriangle and a confusing worldbuilding that would have been amazing if it was handled with more care.  Nalia is a Jinni slave for Malek a mysterious human being who doesnt age. He is mean and has kept her in his presence for the past 3 years because he manages to manipulate Nalia into granting wishes without sacrificing his third and last wish. He punishes her because Nalia often attempts to escape from his mistreatment by putting her back in her bottle. This is a torture method that makes Nalia feel like she is suffocating. Then Raif appears in her life. He is the enigmatic leader of the Arjinnas revolution against the Ifrit. He needs Nalias help to win the war but there is only one way and it seems impossible Nalia needs to get her bottle back from Malek.  The Jinni part was amazing but Heather uses a lot of different terms and throws them easily around in the story. I was sometimes confused what everything meant but slowly I understood the basics of this world. There is Earth and a place called Arjinna where the Jinnis come from. Nalia fled from Arjinna after a coup from the evil Ifrits and they killed her kind the most powerful type of Jinnis Ghan Aisouri. She has been hiding her true appearance to look like a lesser Jinni and became part of the Dark Caravan the slave trade between Arjinna and Earth. Raif is aware of her true identity and he needs one of her secrets for his war against the Ifrit. He and Nalia are sworn enemies and it pains him to ask her for help.  If the information would have been better integrated in the story it would have been less overwhelming. I must give credits for the originality and I was intrigued by the overall worldbuilding. The Arjinnan castes information page was a nice addition. This is also one of the few things I liked about this book because Nalia is thrown into one of the worst lovetriangles Ive seen in a while.  Malek is a cruel guy but Heather tries to make up for his harsh punishments by giving his behavior an explanation. I wasnt swayed by that and that made the romance between Nalia and him disgusting. I dont care for abusive guys. I was disappointed by Nalia and how easily she was swayed by his sweet words and kind temper when he wasnt in one of his moods. In the end she does turn around but I couldnt completely believe her words when there were parts like this in the story  He pulled her closer deepening his kiss and she didnt realize she was kissing him back  that she was suddenly wanting to kiss him back  until a knock sounded at the door startling both of them.  You cant kiss someone without knowing it and just because someone is a good kisser doesnt mean you suddenly forgive their abuse.  She is supposed to be this powerful Jinni but all I could see was a girl that whined too much. I also felt there was too much emphasis on the fact that letting Malek have his way with her was the only answer to get the bottle back.. Nalia had her moments but I wish I saw more of the strong girl I was expecting. The sudden romance between her and Raif went way too fast. He hates her for most part of the book but out of nowhere he kisses her and announces that he loves her. I also didnt care much for him. I found his character a bit dull and shallow.  The ending didnt blow me away either. Now I think about it I dont even recall what exactly happened.. This was a story with potential but it let me down.;Heather Demetrios

Another good story about Susanna  Parker D  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Im a fan of Michelle Dieners series and when she emailed me that I was preapproved on Netgalley I had to read it. I wasnt disappointed. This is yet another wellresearched book filled with action some mystery and many spies. I love it when its clear that the author took time to research their facts. It gives this book a realistic feeling.  Susanna is yet again in danger. Her brother Lucas brings a letter with a secret for Katherine from Margaret. Its about her daughter Mary and her marriages to Emperor Charles. There are many people who are trying to intercept that message and Susanna is portrayed as traitor. Wolsey even manages to get her to the tower but thanks to the queen she gets a fine room instead of a cell in the dungeon. Its up to Parker to prove that Susanna is innocent but he also has to deal with the assassin from book 2. He is not done with Susanna and he wants his jewel.  I really like how actiondriven these stories are. Everything happens fastpaced and there is no time to feel bored. There is this mystery enemy who is trying to kill her before she can deliver the message and Wolsey is back to take revenge. Many things are going on and it was fun to jump around especially when Susanna unravels a plot to murder Henrys bastard son Fitzroy.  The characters are great. I like Susannas attitude and how she stands up for herself. She doesnt pity herself and is always busy to fight back. This book wouldnt have been this good if she was a whiner. There is also the magnificent Parker. I love how protective he is and how he is willing to do everything to keep his Susanna safe. They are so cute together and they have a perfect chemistry. Other sidecharacters are also welldescribed.  Diener delivered another interesting story with much background and I cant wait for other books.;Michelle Diener

A romance in the time of Pandemic would have been a better and more complete title. This book is not about the Blue Flu Pandemic or the tragic events. Its about a teenage girl who makes stupid mistakes falls in love during chaos and who tries to deal with a trauma that has no actual place in the storyline. It was a bit too much of everything instead of focusing on the thing that made me want to read this book the illness.  I like how quickly Lil acts when she orders even more food and survival products before the stores are empty. It was clever of her but unfortunately thats the only good thing I liked about her. Most of her other actions made me shake my head. I dont want to go into details because I think you must find things out by yourself but going out and meeting several people when you are warned.. I would lock myself up and try to avoid human contact  and that was something I expected from such a prepared girl. Instead she wanders around on the street and she goes into a house with a corpse.  Lil was already hoarding stuff to deal with a traumatic happening. She became obsessed with outbreaks and her father is feeding that obsession by giving her information from his work. It seems strange that he isnt more careful when its clear that Lil has lost her way. The whole situation for extra background didnt add anything to the story.  The same for the somewhat lovetriangle which felt forced and out of place. Lil has to deal with her exboyfriend who doesnt know the real reason behind their breakup and a new guy who likes her. Jay (the new boy) is kind. I liked his presence in the story and I could have shipped him with Lily if it was in another situation. But I went into the story hoping to get chaos panic and tension. We do get a little of that but the unnecessarily storylines overpowered it.. When all the stores are empty and the streets are filled with burglars I felt the unsafely situation for the characters.

The whole world is hit by the Blue Flu but some things didnt seem right and were brushed aside. The Flu is supposed to attack people between 5 and 50 instead of the normal age groups. Most of the times babieskids and older people are the ones to go first. This time its different because of Thats right. There is no explanation and I tried thinking of a reason. The only thing is a mutation but it still doesnt make sense. Those age groups are always the first to go because their immune system isnt good enough.

Madelines liferevealed through short bursts of memoryhas hinged around her desperate plan to escape to save herself and her brother. Her only chance lies in destroying the house.In the end can Madeline keep her own sanity and bring the house down The Fallis a literary psychological thriller reimagining Edgar Allan Poes classic The Fall of the House of Usher.;420;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1392302445m18241263.jpg;The Fall;youngadult;I am the one the house speaks to the one the house flirted with the one the house wont let go.  Madeline Usher is cursed just like everyone before her in the family. Her twin brother was send away by their mother in the hope to break free from the curse. Both of their parents die and Madeline is locked in the house together with her doctors. They are monitoring everything and take daily blood samples. The house is a nightmare. It changes and shifts. It talks to Madeline and threatens her but also protects her in a certain way. Its a very strange sort of relationship to read about.  Then the time comes where Madeline gets her fits. Its the first sign of the madness that slowly creeps into the heirs from the house. Its an illness that slowly takes over and always ends in an early death. Madeline sees only one way to escape before it claims her life she must destroy the house but thats not an easy task. The house is alive and not ready to let her go.  The book started out all right. I liked the setting and the overall creepiness of the story. The idea of a living house that changes around you and seeps into your body was scary. Madeline sees how it takes her parents away from her and now she is waiting because she is next in line. Doctors are fascinated by it and she gets daily tests to follow her progress. The thing is with a setting that takes place in one location things do get a little boring. This book would have benefited from less middle part and a better longer ending. It was a bit abrupt and left me unsatisfied and confused at first. It took me a couple of minutes to realize what happened.  The thing that gave me mixed feelings were the chapters. They switch between different points in Madelines life. Every chapter tackled another age and sometimes even a diary entry written by a woman called Liz. It was sometimes confusing to follow the now story and I could have done with a little less hopping around. It made me feel disconnected from Madeline and what was going on in the present story line.  After finishing the book I hunted down a free (legal) copy of the original story Edgar Allan Poe  The fall of the house of Usher and I must applaud Bethany for the way she created her own story. Its influenced by Edgars version but it has its own voice and that was nicely done. I only wish she had handled the jumps in timeline a little better.;Bethany Griffin

We cant let boys define how we feel about ourselves. You have to know who you are before you should let any boy worth anything in.  I rarely read contemporaries but sometimes Im in the mood for something fluffy and this one came highly recommended by Debby from Snuggly Oranges. She raved about it during on of our book club meetings so I decided to download a copy from Edelweiss and Im happy that I did. This is my first meeting with Kasie West and definitely not my last  Charlie is a tomboy. She doesnt wear makeup and instead of shopping she likes to play sports with her brothers and neighbor Branden. When she has another speed ticket her father is done with paying for her mistakes and he forces her to find a job. She ends up in a boutique where she makes friends with some girls who show her that she can combine girly stuff with her daily life. She is also having conversations through the fence with Branden  a boy she is starting to like more and more.  I absolutely loved the family dynamic Charlie her brothers and her father form this great family with flaws and happiness. I liked how there was more depth in the story with the background of her mother. I always have a weakness for books with a focus on family and I liked how protective her brothers are. Its also realistic to see how her father had to deal with the loss of his wife. I thought it was adorable how hard he tried to make sure Charlie has everything she needs.  Most books go wrong for me when they emphasis the romance but I was expecting it and surprised how its never overwhelming. The growing attraction between Branden and Charlie is subtle and cute. I really like it when a friendship turns out into something more. It wasnt hard to connect with Charlie. Ive always been a little tomboyish myself. At the same time I dont mind girly stuff and I liked how Charlie develops in that aspect. She starts to embrace the fact that she is a girl and its perfectly okay to behave like one instead of being tough all the time.  If you look for a cute contemporary with some depth this is the book you should pick up.;Kasie West

This duology is a spinoff for The assassins curse and The pirates wish two books I enjoyed a lot. This story has the same feeling to it and it has the same problem the middle part is sometimes a bit boring.  Hanna is an apprentice for fisherman Kolur. She can practice her wind magic on their trips but this time they end up in a magical storm and they are blown to a place far from their hometown. Kolur adds another woman to their group also a wind magician and he sets sail for a journey. Hanna has no idea what is happening so she escapes and starts to work with another fisher boat for money. The problem is she is still haunted by the Mist which is a group of monsters lead by one man. Her new friend the notsohuman boy is warning her. She must help Kolur on his journey or the Mist will become even more powerful.  First off Cassandra managed to write another story with a great worldbuilding. I liked all the different powers the way she describes the sea and the villages Hanna visits. The only thing is that I wish to see even more of it. The middle part of the book is more about Hanna and her work on the boat. When I came to that point I wish there was more action or character interaction. I dont have the feeling I know much about Hanna at this point only that she can take care or herself and that she is quite intelligent. It was fun to see her magic grow and how she starts to get more control over it.  The Mist is something I remember from The assassins curse. The girl Hanna is named after defeated them but apparently they are back and more dangerous than ever. The idea behind the journey is great and I cant wait to see how that is going to unravel in the sequel. Hannas friend make sure that we know how horrible it is if the Mist succeeds with their plan.  Overall a good solid fantasy book but I hope that the sequel provides more action and character connection.;Cassandra Rose Clarke

My first thoughts after finishing this book NOPE. Why did I even finish this book I have no idea because the ending makes the book feel like we returned to the beginning. Its almost like there was no point to this story and that made it suck even more.  Wendy is still looking for her two brothers who disappeared six months ago. She is convinced they are still alive surfing somewhere. Its obvious that she is in denial and its not strange with the nonsupportive friends and family. Her parents are too busy with their own grief and Fiona doesnt want to understand Wendy.  This doesnt mean that Wendy handles things the right way either. One day she just moves in with Pete in his house carved in the rock at the beach. She just met the guy he kissed her after a couple of hours and he was creeping me out. I really didnt like the rash decisions of Wendy. Or how Pete is already talking about being in love with her and how he lies to keep her there. So many things were wrong and this prevented me from seeing them as a possible couple. Plus what the hell where her parents doing in the mean time I sincerely hope they noticed her absence but I wasnt given any clue they were looking for her when she gets home the first time..  To make the creepy crew complete there is also drugs dealer Jas. He is the archenemy of Pete but I did like him a little better. At least he was honest and helpful but again she goes with him on a road trip to a place her brothers might be after their second meeting. The first time she ended up hallucinating at Fionas house because she took drugs. Girl did your parents never teach you to stay away from strangers Jas is also the second character she instantly falls in love with but that almost didnt come as a surprise. I know that the blurb hinted this but I hoped there was more time or at least a magical feeling. The romances went completely wrong for me. (Instalove in the first 30 pages I mean. Come on)  I also disliked how her parents keep telling her she is imaging things. They dont believe her story and say its only a way to deal with her brothers death. And everything felt so flat. Besides annoyance for Wendys stupid decisions and a lot of head shakes for the instaloves I didnt feel a thing. Combined with the ending which failed to end the story properly I wouldnt recommend this not succeeded attempt for a contemporary Peter Pan retelling. 2 stars for originality and the fact I managed to finish it.;Alyssa B.

Hello pretty cover hello interesting blurb you got me fooled again. This book left me bored and disconnected with any of the characters. It was very disappointing.  Serafina is the daughter of Queen of Miromara. She must perform a Songspell to prove she will be the next Queen. But of course things dont go according to plan her mother is hit by a poisoned arrow and Serafine must flee with her best friend whose name I already forgot. They run get captured are saved run some more bladiebla. The purpose of this book was in the end that Serafine is one of the six to stop a monster from breaking loose into their world.  The main problem was my disconnection with the story and therefore the characters. We are thrown right into the story which doesnt have to be a problem but the author is trying TOO hard to create an unique world. I was drowning in a sea of confusion by all the details and information. Instead of being wrapped into the story I couldnt give a single fuck (sorry for the language.) I wish she used all those names places food and whatever she was talking about with more care. It could have turned out into a good worldbuilding but I ended up skipping everything hoping for the plot to kick in.  Serafina is like the story boring. She isnt such a bad character but there was nothing special about her and I didnt care about her fate. She is also in constant need of guidance and support I expected her to have more strength. Her best friend was more interesting but apparently not memorable because I seriously cant remember her name.. Prince Mahdi was hardly mentioned in the book but the things I saw about him disappoint me. What I did like was the fact that there is no romance in this book. I was already waiting for instalove or a lovetriangle but there is none. Serafina is actually quite smart when it comes to protecting her heart and she is realistic in her feelings for Mahdi.  Throughout the story I was hoping for action or spectacular magic. The middle part wasnt exciting at all. It became more interesting when Serafina and the six girls arrive at the witches but that is where the book comes to an ending. It almost feels like this book is a prequel or a stepup for the true story. I might try the sequel in the hope that all the details were dumped here so we can continue with the real story  which is in concept pretty interesting.;Jennifer Donnelly

This story was unexpected painful but I should have known. This is the author from Tiger Lily one of the rare books that make my eyes watery. This book isnt fantastic and I wish I loved it more than I did but the twist at the end tugged at my heart. My main complaint where the characters. I didnt like Pauline and Liam Maggie was okay but not fleshed out. I hated how Pauline played with Liams feelings and how she couldnt be happy for Maggie. If it wasnt for the feelings at the end there is a chance this book would have ended with 2.5 stars instead.

I was looking for a little more tension in this book. Based on the blurb I was expecting a killer on the loose but it was a murder with reason and there is hardly any action. I did like the solution for the mystery but was also underwhelmed by it. I guess I was just this disappointed because I loved Smart girls get what they want.  Lily is working on the graveyard when she is attacked by Erin. She is accused of stealing Erins boyfriend Matt who is a good friend of her. When Erin is found dead in her tub the next day suicide people gossip that its Lilys fault. That is until Lily finds out that the police think she has been killed. Lily hopes to clean her Matts name when the police points them out as main suspects.  I never felt connected to Lily Matt or the romance. Erin was a raving lunatic and the only characters I really liked were the secondary family members  who play little roles in the story. I think the author tried to make Lily a bit goofy. She dresses strange she grew up in a moratorium where her family works and all the things she does are supposed to be different but it felt a little forced to me. I was shown how Lily was instead of feeling. I also didnt like how she went behind her mothers back by meeting Matt in secret. It was great that she believed in him but based on evidence I wouldve stayed away from him.  The mystery was never very engaging to me. I could care less whether they found the murderer because I never felt any tension. Based on the blurb I thought there might be more victims or at least a treat but nothing happens. I also thought it was strange how a teenage girl is capable of finding more information than the police. It was also far too convenient how Lily finds out that Erin is murdered. I hope its not something that happens in real life because her mothers boyfriend (who is part of the investigation) mailed her mother some inside secret information  This is actually all I have to say about the book. Its disappointing.;Sarah Strohmeyer

Plagued by obsessivecompulsive disorder Matthew is consumed with repeated thoughts neurotic rituals and crippling fear. Both in desperate need of someone to help them reach out to the world Amy and Matthew are more alike than either ever realized.When Amy decides to hire student aides to help her in her senior year at Coral Hills High School these two teens are thrust into each others lives.

I like to pick my contemporary books carefully and when I came across this book I decided to just go for it and request it. Im so happy I did because this book is now one of my favorites. Its about two strong characters who develop an unique friendship where they both have to deal with their own problems. I loved their relationship and how they look at life. It showed me that its up to you what you do with your life even when every day is a struggle.  Amy was born with cerebral palsy which is simply said damage in the motor control part of the brain. This means she cant walk without a walker talk without her voice box or control her facial expressions  which also gives her problems with swallowing and eating. She has a help by her side until she realizes that this prevents her from making friends so her wealthy mother trains peers from her age to accompany her. One of those helpers is Matthew who is plagued by his obsessivecompulsive disorder. His daily life is controlled by his thoughts and rituals but its different when he is around Amy. Despite all odds the two of them become best friends.  I am not a victim of fashion or cultural pressure because there is no place for me in the culture I see. In having fewer options I am freer than any other teenage I know.  I was touched by Amy and how incredibly strong this girl is. She doesnt want to be defined by her condition. She wants to show the world how much she has to offer and like everyone else she wants friends. Its unbelievable how she is able to deal with all of this  and how real Cammie made her feel to me. I had the idea that Amy was a real breathing girl. It was like I was a little person in her head able to see the world through her eyes and thoughts. It was a wonderful experience and it puts things I worry about in another perspective.  There is also her best friend Matthew. There were so many times where I wanted to hug him and tell him that everything was going to be all right. His thoughts were scary and worrisome. It was hard to see him slip further into his compulsions but I also admired him for standing up in the end. He was brave enough to face his problems and do something about it.  I believe there are choices each of us makes every single day. We can dwell on our limitations or we can push ourselves past them. I have learned not to judge people by their limitations but by the way they push past them.  Seeing these characters together was delightful. Matthew is exactly the kind of person Amy needs. He is not afraid to tell her the truth because he doesnt believe in sugar coating things. He is also careful and caring around her. At the same time Amy is also the kind of person Matthew needs. She challenges him and changes his outlook on life. This unexpected friendship where soon more feelings start to blossom was such a lovely thing to see. The ending was a little openended but I thought it fit the overall feeling of this book and it brought a smile on my face.  Read this book. You wont regret it;Cammie McGovern

This was again a very entertaining Middle Grade book. Its filled with witches dark magic and a strong main character. I think this book contains some good messages like how it depends on the person whether they turn good or evil.  Kara raises her brother Taff after her mothers death the night she was found to be a witch. Her father is shattered by her death and all he does is scribbling tales in a notebook. Kara was tested but she was free of magic thats what she has been telling herself too. But when she finds her mothers diary all the barriers break down and Kara finds out that she is good with animal magic. Grace is loved by the village but she harbours a dark heart and bad intentions. She takes Karas grimoire away and starts a destruction only Kara can end.  If you have a sensitive child I dont recommend this book. Its dark and can be scary for a younger audience. I personally loved that aspect. Kara is suffering from her mothers execution. People are talking smack behind her back and everyone looks disdainful at her and her family. Her fathers mental break down doesnt make it any easier. Taff is sick and Kara does everything to nurse him even when that means she has to take everything from Grace. This girl might have the looks of an angel she is evil. It was sad to see how bad people treat Kara and how easy they believe everything Grace tells them. It is also a realistic portrayal of life and I found Kara such an admirable girl. She deals with it and doesnt let them take her spirit away.  It was interesting to see how the magic pulls her away from her friendly nature. Every chapter becomes darker and darker until Kara is completely wrapped in dark magic. This reminded me of Rumplestiltskin all magic comes with a price.  Its a good thing Kara has support from an unexpected friend. Its hard for her to battle against it but she friends the strength something Grace doesnt have. This girl.. Even her last act of magic is one to punish Kara and I was very surprised by that twist on the end I first wasnt aware this was part of a series but that ending shows me that a sequel is coming and I cant wait.;J.A.

Bees certainly have interesting habits and customs. It was sad to read about the destruction in their hive by human hands..  The most problematic thing about this book was the fact that Lalines writing lacked feeling. This book never really grabbed me but its also possible this is the result of having nonhuman characters. It had a distant feeling so I was never completely swept away by the story.  This book centers around Flora who starts as a sanitation bee  the lowest class in a hive. Throughout the story she climbs through different ranks which even brings her in the presence of her Holy Majesty. She has to deal with many things from wasp attacks to a sickness that spreads through the hive and the most problematic thing she is laying eggs.

Yes. That is correct. I gave this book a contemporary 5 glowing flowers. If you are a frequent visitor you might be aware that I dont read many fluffy contemporaries. I never thought I would ever find one I enjoyed so much that I would give it 5 flowers but leave it up to Kasie West to change that. I first devoured her Pivot Point series and then I really enjoyed On the fence. With this book as prove I can easily say she is now on my autobuy list.  Gia is always the one to dump a guy so when her boyfriend Bradley breaks up with her in the parking lot right before prom she does the last thing she can think off to save her reputation take a fillin guy to portray as Bradley. That has to satisfy Jules who is trying to work Gia out of their group. The nameless boy acts perfectly until his sister shows up who clearly hates Gia. After their break up at prom and the fact she cant stop thinking about him life is turning to be more complicated than Gia anticipated.  There was something fragile about Gia and I love her development in her story. She is by no means a perfect character and she does many stupid things. The person she was in the beginning was in need of the change and the way she matured felt realistic. Despite not having the same struggle as Gia there was something about her I identified with. Her longing to be liked and her loneliness among her friends was understandable. Her need for social likes was also something I recognize myself in every now and then so that could be confronting.  Her nameless guy is absolutely adorable. Their chemistry is the best and I loved their moments of banter. He supports her and gives her space to change. His sister Bec was also a highlight of the story. She doesnt shy away from saying what she believes and I like that she embraces Gia in her life despite everything Gia did to her.  I think this book worked so well for me because of the balance between deeper stuff and romance. It had the right amount of fluff and story. I often feel a little overwhelmed by the emphasis on romance in contemporaries (reason I tend to stay away) but this book hit the right notes for me. This was combined with many funny scenes that made me laugh out loud so I would say this is the perfect book for the summer.    Do you see that SAY WHAT MEL You give 5 stars to a contemporary (For the people who dont know me I rarely read contemporary and Im all about fantasy  fairytale retellings.)  Yes. Yes I do. It surprises me too but this book deserves nothing less )  Its adorable. Its cute. Its filled with banter insecurity and loneliness even when you are among friends. Its about a girl who changes the way she looks at the world. Its about finding new friends. Its about realizing your life wasnt as perfect as you thought.  There were some moments that really struck a cord with me and while I wasnt the same as Gia I definitely understood some of her situations and choices.  The only thing that could have used some more work perhaps was Jules. We KNOW she has a difficult home situation and thats why she is acting like a huge bitch but we never know WHAT is exactly going on. I wish we could have seen more of that. This made it hard to feel anything else than hate for her..  This is one of those rare books you have to read in one sitting. It has been a while since I had one of those and I needed this. Leave it up to Kasie West to make me give a contemporary 5 stars Genius.  So. Yep. Review will follow soon );Kasie West

This book makes up for the disappointing Fragments. The worldbuilding is better the characters more developed and the story is exciting. There arent many books out there with such a solid biological aspect and that was by far my favorite part of this series.  Love is when you find something so great so.. necessary that it becomes more important to you than your own goals than your own life  not because your life has no meaning without it but because it gives your life a meaning it never had before.  There are different storylines which helps to see the situation from several POVs. Its handled with grace and it wasnt overwhelming. The main story floats smoothly through all the stories and combines them in an perfect ending. I loved it.  To tell the big lines Kira is tested by Dr. Morgan and when they cant find the answers in her DNA she escapes to find a group of Partials. Its still not completely realistic that a seventeenyearold girl discovers the solution instead of Dr. Morgan who has been looking for a solution for years but okay. We see more of Delarosa who wants to destroy all the Partials with her secret mission and Kiras friends who try to protect the first healthy baby. Like I said there is a lot going on and this makes the story thrilling. There is not a single boring moment and I was captivated from the moment I started.  About the characters Kira is still a smart cookie. I like her attitude and how she wants to sacrifice her life to save everyone. The only down side is that she doesnt sees her own value which makes her a bit rash. Her feelings are also a jumbling mess and I didnt care for the somewhat lovetriangle that tries to introduce itself. What I also liked is the fact that every character has its own voice. The secondary characters arent blended together in one voice and that provides a good cast.  The biological aspect It all sounds plausible. Its clear that Wells knows what he talks about (or he just knows how to deliver it.) The concept of this book has been good from the beginning and he keeps the quality. The cure makes sense (I secretly expected this to be the cure too but that didnt make it less enjoyable) and its good to see a book that doesnt talk bullshit when it comes to the biology. I believed it.  The ending YES this is how you end a series. A good conclusion to the story but still enough room to think about the future. Every question is answered and I was genuinely happy how everything came together. You might say its a bit toohappilyeverafter but seeing how much suffering there has been for years I dont mind it was satisfying.  I look forward to more work of this author and Im going to end this review with one of the best quotes in this book  Nobody has a destiny. I mean nobody has some kind of inescapable path for their life. This mug was made from clay and that clay could have been anything at all until somebody made it into a mug. People arent mugs we are clay. Living breathing thinking feeling clay and we can shape ourselves into anything we want and we keep shaping ourselves all our lives getting better and better at whatever we want to be and when we want to be something else we just smooth out the clay and start over. Your lack of purpose is the single best thing about you because it means you can be whatever you want.;Dan Wells

I didnt connect with the story because Elizabeth (the mother of Anne Mary  George Boleyn) tells the story. It almost felt like reading an interview or a diary. And since this is a story I already know I didnt feel it added something specialunique to define itself from other books.  I also had a hard time with her as a character. Vain arrogant and always busy with unimportant things I found it hard to believe her sadness when she loses her two children. She always looked down on Anne the ugly Duckling who couldnt be her daughter. It doesnt go well with me if you love your other two children more than the other and she isnt even ashamed about it.  The only big worry in her life was her beauty. She didnt like being pregnant because it spoiled her youth and pretty looks. I can understand that being pregnant and losing so many children isnt pleasant but damn I dont have to hear it every page And being jealous of your own ugly duckling because she turned into a beautiful swan is just disgusting.  She is mad at her husband Thomas because he sentences his children to their death but she isnt blameless herself.

I was afraid the story might have an somewhat open ending but thats not the case.  EDIT  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Game of Thrones meets the Grimms fairy tales in this twisted fastpaced romantic fantasyadventure about Sleeping Beautys daughter a warrior princess who must fight to reclaim her throne.  Game of Thrones Not really but the twisted fantasyadventure description comes close my thoughts.  Genderbender is one of my favorite things and its nicely explored. Niklaas is in search for Princess Aurora because she is his only chance on breaking the curse put on him and his brothers. He believes he stumbles on her brother who he is more than happy to help the boy in return for an introduction to his sister. What Niklaas doesnt know is that Aurora lures him into her plan to save her brother from the Goblin Queen.  This book is written from the POV of Niklaas and Aurora. It was not necessarily to me. Yes it gave some funny situations where we hear Niklaas complain about the toopretty and annoying boy but I didnt like him all that much. He sometimes had annoying thoughts about females in general and his arrogant boosting got on my nerves. Hes not a bad person but the author could have toned it down a little to make him more appealing to me. The only positive thing is that you get to see his character develop in a more likable person.  Aurora was far more fascinating to me. I like that shes able to stay in her role as her brother and that she will do anything to free him. She puts herself into dangerous situation and it might be a bit rash but I saw where she was coming from. I would do anything in my power to protect my little sister too. Her banter with Niklaas was entertaining and this girl isnt afraid to speak her mind. She is ready to show Niklaas how strong women can be.  The story had its up and downs. I wouldnt say its slow but its also not fastpaced. The plot simply moves forward in a steady pace thats neither thrilling nor boring. I would say its more centered around the interaction and growing friendship between Niklaas and Aurora. Which is fine but dont go into this book expecting much action or excitement.  The ending was interesting and it held a twist that surprised me. It gave the villain more vulnerability and you finally saw the reason behind her gruesome deeds. I always like it when villains are portrayed as people who make bad choices instead of being 100 evil. The complexity gave the story something extra and while its not the best retelling ever I think this will appeal to fairytale fans.;Stacey Jay

Its so worth the hype.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  The wrath an the dawn is inspired by A thousand and one nights and it is all I could have wished for. I fell in love with both characters their chemistry and the true reason behind the sacrifices Khalid makes. The ending definitely leaves you hanging and wanting for more. This is one of the best books Ive read this year and I am so happy this is a hyped book that truly lived up to my expectations.  Khalid marries a new bride every day and he has her executed in the morning. Sharhzad volunteers to be his next victim and she is hellbent on stopping him. In the evening she tells him a story and this captivates him in such a way he lets her live. Night after night she weaves a tale and during the time they spend together Sharzhad starts to realize that Khalid might not be the monster she thought he would be. She starts to question her mission and her new feelings confuse her.  Sharzhad is amazing. She is fierce and intelligent. You must be really brave and strong if you take the decision to become his new bride. Sharzhad could lose everything but her cunning mind saves her. I loved how her feelings develop throughout the story. The two start with a crazy chemistry that sparked from the pages. The author had a perfect timing for the romance and the different stages between I hate everything you are to I think Im starting to fall for you. Sharhzad always has these moments of doubt even when she starts to see him in a different light. The approach to their unique relation made it feel realistic and I shipped it so hard.  In the end everything seems to fall apart. The world is no longer the same and Khalid knew from the beginning what he was starting when he didnt execute Sharhzad. I admired him for making such a choice and the fact he managed to carry such a heavy burden. He maintained an air of mystery throughout the story. I dont feel I got to know him as well as Sharzhad but I really appreciate his character. I cant wait to learn more about him.  There is a slight touch of a lovetriangle but the author handles this with care and in such a way that it makes sense. Tariq is Sharzhads youth friend and the two of them seemed to have plans to get married in the future. Its not strange she is torn apart by two different futures especially because she went into the palace with murder in her mind  and now she is defending the same man from being killed.  The cliffhanger at the end is simultaneously the worst and the best. This is the right way to use a cliffhanger but at the same time I only want more more more;Renee Ahdieh

Fantastic ending to a good duology. The story has been told and it has a satisfying conclusion. This is the reason some trilogies should be duologies. The romance between Wren and Callum was adorable but not overwhelming. There is a lot of action. The only thing I wanted was a little more worldbuilding but it wasnt necessarily to enjoy the story.  After freeing Callum Wren and a group of Reboots escaped to the north where they arrived at the Reboot Reservation. The feeling of being save quickly disappears when the plans of Micah the leader becomes clear. Wren might be the strongest Reboot but that doesnt stop Micah from kidnapping her with Addie. When Callum finds out that Wren is dumped into enemy territory he will do everything to rescue the love of his life.  It was interesting to see the story with a dual POV between Wren and Callum. Wren was brainwashed by HARC and she is starting to realize that she isnt a bad person just because she is good in killing people. I really like how she developed in this story. Going from an emotionless killing machine to a much warmer girl. It doesnt mean that she lost her strength. She is still brave strong and she doesnt shy away from violence when needed. The way Callum looks at Wren was adorable. The two are meant for each other and their stolen moments brought a smile on my face. This is how romance should be incorporated in a Dystopian tale. Not overwhelming and it adds something to the story.  Micah whose actions scream bad guy has his own story to tell. In a way I could understand his actions and why is so fiercely against humans. I dont agree with him but I dont think it was strange he feels that way. It made me look different at Reboots and Humans which raised an interesting question would it really be that bad if every potential RebootHuman become a Reboot Like Micah says they are better designed Humans.  The ending is perfect. All the answers and storylines are told but there is still some space left for your own imagination. I wish every Dystopian author could write a satisfying conclusion like this. I look forward to see more of Amy Tinteras work.;Amy Tintera

This story is a grownup retelling from East of the moon west of the sun. Michelle contacted me to ask if I wanted to be a betareader. Im still honored she asked me and she even mentioned my name in the acknowledgement The basic of this story  Summary.  Astrid is bought by an icebear to live in his castle for a year. Her father is greedy and her family is in need of money  and the enchanted icebear can provide for that. He is actually a prince cursed by a troll to find a girl within a year. He must sleep in her bed but she cant see his face in the night thats when he returns to his human shape. Astrid is of course curious but she only breaks this rule when the icebear (Bjorn) is wounded in battle. He is swept away by the troll and he is now forced to marry her daughter making sure she will rule the country. Astrid isnt planning on letting that happen. On her journey to this impossible place Astrid finds out about her new strength and with a trick she knows how to free him.  Opinion.  The first thing I liked about this book is Astrid. The only reason she accepts is to save some family members. Most of them are harsh and unkind but her mother and younger brother have a special place. She is brave fearless and she knows how to stand up for herself. It was interesting to see how she grows and develops into the character she is supposed to be. I liked her quick mind and temper so she was definitely a character I was rooting for.  The first time I read this book as a beta I had a lot of trouble with Bjorn. He said and did certain things that made me dislike him even so much that I hoped he would be an icebear forever. Michelle did some adjustments and they completed the story for me. It shows how frustrating it is for Bjorn to switch between icebear and human. I could understand his need for change but I still liked how he gives Astrid space to adjust to the new situation. It was fun to see why he picked Astrid and how their fate was settled in a situation long ago.  Most retellings are YA and it was refreshing to read something that was more for adults. It made it very easy to connect with Astrid and Im looking forward to perhaps more retellings from Michelle.;Michelle Diener

This book was terribly slow. The author tries to tell a story in 397 pages when I could have done it in perhaps 50 pages. The setting sounded interesting and there is no initial instalove until the dreaded from the moment I saw you I knew we were meant to be line halfway. In combination with the boring plot Im going to say nope to this book. Not for me.  More elaborate review.  The first half of the book is about Jayden and her struggle to accept her arranged marriage to the dude who is going to lead the camp. They meet a wounded stranger and he becomes part of their group  and of course she falls in love with him. The last half is her trying to get out of the marriage and a lot of blabla.  I felt like the culture was very stereotype and I couldnt care for all the belly dancing. It never felt genuine to me more like this is what they are supposed to do so Im going to put it into the storyline.  We also have a typical MC who is pretty but she doesnt know it and it always looking for confirmation that she is. She is always whining while the author is trying to show how strong she is  a weird combination that fails to deliver. I have still no freaking clue who the mysterious guy is. He has the personality of a sheet of paper. The only thing I know is that he comes from a rich family and that he is gorgeous.

Here comes a bookish confession I have written a Harry Potter fan fiction. It was years ago when I was writing a lot of stories and poems when I came up with a HP version and it was quite popular. Not as big as Caths fan fiction but I had an audience so I know how much fun it is when people read your story. (And no I will never share it on my blog and it is written in Dutch anyway). Its not hard to imagine that I loved this book I won Fangirl over at Gabby so thanks  Cath and Wren are twins and they are huge fans of Simon Snow. They write their own SimonBaz fan fiction until they go to university. Wren wants to start her own life and she pushes Cath and all their interests away for parties and new friends. Cath has a hard time adapting to all the changes in her life and she is even more obsessed with her Snowfandom. The only people she allows are her roommate Reagan and her friend Levi but even they cant get Cath much out of her room.  Ive seen people complain about the fan fiction parts between chapters and while it was a little distracting I also liked it. It gave me more insight in Cath and while it wasnt my favorite part of the book it seem to complete the story for me. It also helped me to identify even more with Cath and we connected on a personal level. Im not a party type like Cath and I never let other people talk me into doing things I dont like. Id rather sit on my room and read a book then leave the house to go to a party. Cath is shy and quiet but at the same time a great character to be around when she opens up. She gets anxious when she meets new people or when she is thrown into new situations. This is exactly how I am and it was interesting to see my personality reflected in a book character. It was also a confrontation and it made me think about myself.  Her connection with Levi is adorable. I liked how he challenges her but at the same time he understands how she feels and thinks. Its such a balanced and respectful bond and it made me smile. He is a genuine good person and he is always there for his friends. It wasnt strange she let him into her life even when she was scared. I was definitely rooting for them.  Wren left me confused because I didnt get her sudden change. I understand she wanted to define herself as her own person instead of being the twins again but she went loose. She throws herself into parties and drinks alcohol because everyone drinks it. I dont care for people who think that way. You dont have to be a sheep to be liked. I guess it was also her way to deal with some hard parts in their life like the weakness of her father and the abandonment from their mother. I liked how these tougher aspects provided some balance in the overall fluff story.  I was very surprised by how much I liked it seeing Im not a big contemporary reader. If you want to read a book about a girl who starts to adapt to her new life while dealing with a boyfriend and real life problems this is the book you want to try.;Rainbow Rowell

Jennifer dies in a freaky accident and Violet finally gets her chance with Greg. She hates Celine who is the image of her mother and she punishes the girl. Celine bored me to death. She is gorgeous but thats the only interesting thing about her. I like what the author tried to do (dont judge people by their looks) but this girl.. only complaining about the fact that she is beautiful.  There is a ridiculous twist towards the ending which involves getting a Superstar to kiss Celine out of her magical coma. Violet suddenly sees the light  sure and decides to change her life. I didnt buy it.  Shame but this is my last book by the author. I need to get my fairytale kick somewhere else.;Alex Flinn

The first story shows some more of Elisas sister and I liked that we got to see her POV. We only know her as the better sister who hates Elisa but now we get to see thats not true. She values Elisa at the end of the story and I loved to see that development in their relationship.  THERE IS A HECTOR STORY.

It has been a while since I read Splintered so I was sometimes confused when they referred to certain occurrences. That didnt bother me too much though but it might have played a role in my feelings about the story. I was a little underwhelmed by this book. It felt a bit flat and slowpaced to me.  I fell in love with the dark twist on Wonderland that was created in Splintered. I liked all the problems Alyssa had to solve and how she was guided by Morpheus. In this book Alyssa is back in her real world where she is trying to return to her normal life. Its difficult when Morpheus keeps popping up asking her to return to Wonderland to reclaim her throne before it is too late.  This sounded fantastic to me. Unfortunately it wasnt. This book seemed to suffer from the middlepartsyndrome where everything is a setup for the conclusion in the final book. Alyssa is set on staying in the real world where she can stay with the horrible Jeb. Im still not a fan of him. He shows so little interest in Alyssa and I just dont care about him or their romance. Their relationship doesnt feel balanced to me especially when Alyssa keeps worrying about his feelings for her. She is jealous and afraid he will cheat on her bad signs in a relation that is still so new.  At the same time I also dont see Morpheus as a real loveinterest. Yes he is an interesting character and I like his bad personality but I dont think he would be good to Alyssa. He lies keeps important information behind and he is a great manipulator. Not the traits for a boyfriend if you ask me. It does suit him and its logical because he is from Wonderland where everything is dangerous and twisted.  Now that we have those negative things out of the way I certainly enjoyed parts of this book. I liked the mystery around Alyssas mosaics and her mothers  fathers past. Alyssa is also a good character. I dont always agree with her choices and thoughts but I like her and how realistic she feels. She isnt perfect and I like how hard she tries to make the best out of the situation that is starting to spin out of her control. I cant wait to see her come to her full potential in the final book Ensnared which will be set in Wonderland again. The ending of Unhinged definitely makes me want to read it as soon as possible.;A.G. Howard

I love how she makes the paranormal touch feel so natural like its something that happens every day. Review will follow.  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  Cat Winters has been on my favorite list ever since I read In the shadow of blackbirds. She followed up with the fantastic The cure for dreaming and she has settled her place with The uninvited. Every single one of her books have been successful and I absolutely adore her writing and the strong heroines she creates.  The setting takes places in the last days of World War I in 1918 during the Spanish Flu pandemic. The world is in panic and Ivy has to deal with the fact her father and brother killed a German out of retaliation for her brothers death in the war with Germany. Shocked she flees home and is swept away in a world of jazz. She doesnt know how to deal with her feelings of guilt and decides to visit Daniel. He is a German who has to deal with a lot of prejudice and he suffers from the loss of his brother at the hands of Ivys family. The two of them start an unique relation.  I loved the setting. If a book mentions something about a sickness Im all up for it and Winters has a fantastic use of the Flu pandemic. The whole book has a dark atmosphere because of the widespread hysteria. We get to see whole neighbourhoods that fall for the Flu and how little care there is for its victims. Ivy helps out with the transport (and at the end you realize how utterly brilliant this is) and I admired the fact she took that risk.  This brings me to Ivy who immediately stole my heart. She cant put up any longer with her brother and abusive father so she walks away to an uncertain future. She has no place and no money but her intelligence brings her far and soon she is settled down. Ivy is also able to see The Uninvited ones ghost from people who herald impending death. The way Winters wrote about this aspect of the story felt so real. It never felt out of place and it made a lot of sense. There was a mental strength to her and I liked being able to see the world through her eyes. It took a lot of courage to visit Daniel especially because it is dangerous to connect yourself to a German during this time and I love their dynamic. Daniel is a bitter person after everything he had to endure but I warmed up to him easily. They bring out the good parts of each other and its interesting to see how their relation developed.  The story itself is a quiet one. There are no big climaxes or dramatic situations. It is more about the atmosphere and how IvyDaniel try to battle with the hatred against all Germans. History lessons never really touched the subject about how Germans were treated in other parts of the world so it made an impression on me.  The twisty ending place everything in a new perspective and I must applaud Winters for coming up with such a conclusion. It ties everything together and explains a lot. It was very powerful and it punched me in the face. A book with an ending that leaves you speechless for a few moments is definitely worth a try.;Cat Winters

This book is pitched as a companion novel to Not a drop to drink but I recommend to see this one as a sequel. The story relies on information you get in Not a drop to drink and I think it will make this story much more impressive if you know what happened to the characters in the first book.  Lucy grew up in the care of Lynn her adoptive mother. Lynn has been thought all her life to take care of their pond the only way they can survive in this world where water is scarce  until she and Lucy are forced to leave the only safe world they know. Lynn has heard rumours about a desalinization plant at the coat in California and she and Lucy set out on a dangerous journey across the land to reach that destination.  This book has the same tense and creepy atmosphere as Not a drop to drink. The only difference is that the situation is even worse because now they have to survive without their safe haven. Their adventure across the country would have killed me. They have to be careful and are always aware of the potential dangers that surround them. I was constantly fearing for their lives waiting for something to happen. There are some gruesome situations which was perfect to show the desperation and how that forces people to do horrible things.  Its obvious Lynns mother taught her well this girl has a crazy talent for survival. I admire her and how she finds a solution for all their problems. There is something breakable about her though despite her cold and strong behavior. This is the Lynn I met in Not a drop to drink but its also clear she has grown over the years. Her bond with Lucy is heartwarming. These two met under strange circumstances and its clear they care a lot for each other.  I liked that this book focuses on Lucy and its written from her POV in third person. Her soft and somewhat naive heart have an interesting effect on Lynn  something we also saw in Not a drop to drink. Its good that Lucy never changed and that she strays true to her real nature that no matter what Lynn says shes always able to see the good things in humans.  There is one thing that disappointed me and thats the lack of romance. I know This is coming from me. Mindy touches the subject very briefly like in Not a drop to drink but I felt it should have played a more prominent role in this book or she should have kept it out of the story completely. It felt a bit like a plot hole as if she sometimes forgot about it and then suddenly remembered it was there. She could have handled it with more care but it also shows that she can be brutal and isnt afraid to put her characters into misery.  The ending is satisfying but also made me wish she was planning to write another book about Lynn and Lucy. Im not done with them.;Mindy McGinnis

I was a big fan of The burning sky and while this book was good it didnt live up to the first one. The plot was a bit too slow and that made me look at the missing worldbuilding. Still it gave me all the IolantheTitus feelings. For some strange reason I never wrote a review for The burning sky so Im going to include some of my thoughts about that book as well (spoiler free)  The perilous sea throws you right into the middle of a new situation. We get to see Iolanthe and Titus but they deal with memory loss and have no idea who they are and where they are. The next chapter talks about the events before this happening and the chapters switch back and forth. I like that we unravel the story this way but at the same time I sometimes wanted to read more from one time line.  IolantheTitus are delightful again. Titus found out that The One might be someone else but Iolanthe is not ready to be pushed aside. This gives some tension between the two and a lot of banter. Sherry luckily stays away from the sappy lovemoments we often have in the sequel. It made me ship them even harder.  We get to spend more time in the Crucible and I loved that part. Its such a fascinating idea that you can use a book as portal to travel to other places  and the stories can help you out like the part where they meet the Oracle to ask important questions. It would be amazing to have a book like that in real life. I would use it to conquer some of my fears like talking in front of a crowd.  This brings me to the part that lacks. While the Crucile is nicely explained I still dont get the worldbuilding. Is their magical world integrated in our world or is it someplace else I was more aware of these missing details because the plot is a bit slower. It could have used some extra excitement but the ending made up for it by a twist I never expected. I highly anticipate the next and last book.;Sherry Thomas

This book proves to me that its not always bad to base an opinion on the cover. When I scrolled through Netgalley I was captured by the cover and after reading the blurb I knew I had to request it. Luckily I was shown that pretty cover and a good story can go hand in hand. Be ready to unravel the story behind the Queen of Hearts.  Colleen excels in telling a story I havent seen before. We all know Alice in Wonderland and there are several retellings but the Queen of Hearts is perhaps even more fascinating. I really liked what Colleen did and how she gives this villain a believable background. It makes me feel sad for the future Queen and its not strange that she turns out that way.  Dinah is a passionate intelligent girl who grows up in a harsh environment. Her mother died when she was a young girl and her father has always resented her. Its clear that he hates Dinah and he does everything to make her feel miserable. He is such a merciless King that he made me feel sick. He is a beast and its not strange that his people are loyal to him they are scared as hell.  Dinahs life is only bearable because of her best friend Wardley (future Knave of Hearts) and her adviser Harris (the white rabbit) There were many times where I wanted to hug her. People are laughing at her and they gossip behind her back  they even suspect she is just as mad as her younger brother Charles (mad hatter). In order to maintain her status as Princess she needs to act harsh. I liked how feisty she is but there is also a darkness luring behind the surface. I like her realistic flawed personality and how strong she is in her situation. Her father puts her in a difficult position especially when he announces that Dinah has a halfsister named Vittiore.  When Dinah is contacted by a mysterious stranger she decides its time to take action. Together with Wardley she goes on a trip to the Black Towers to talk to a prisoner. This grim place pretty much sums up what a horrible man her father is. The world torture doesnt even cover whats going on here. The meeting ends up in beheadings and eventually Dinah must flee for her life.  I like all the mystery around Vittiore the sinister events and the cute moments between Dinah and Wardley. Colleen described Wonderland in such a way that I felt I was there and the unexpected twist leading to the ending makes me anxious for the next book. It was a good cliffhanger. If you look for something refreshing when it comes to fairy tales this is a book I highly recommend.;Colleen Oakes

I loved Miss Peregrine and the unique use of photographs. There is something about books that use this method like The cure for dreaming  In the shadow of blackbirds that fascinate me. It adds an extra dimension of creepiness to the story and its really effective for this book filled with Peculiar children and monsters. It creates the right atmosphere and it feels like I get to know the characters in a different way because now you can literally see them.  This story takes off right after the end of the first book. The Peculiar children are fleeing from their island with Miss Peregrine captured in birdform. They must find a way to get her back before it is too late. They need to travel through other timeloops to find the last person who can help them Miss Wren. During their hopping through timeloops they find out that Peculiars are disappearing. There is something dangerous going on and they need Miss Peregrine back.  I liked the different places and people they see on their journey. The author put a lot of work in creating a big cast with diverse characters. They go from place to place which made it easy to fly through the pages and I found it hard to put Hollow City down but keep in mind that the plot still is slower than the average book. You need to be able to appreciate Riggs way of telling the story because I can also see how this series is not going to work for some people.  Miss Peregrines home for Peculiar children feels more like a setup in comparison with Hollow City. This book is filled with action and its far more fastpaced. The Peculiar children are on the run and they have to use their unique talents to stay out of the hands from the Hollows  and what a scary figures are those  I liked that we see more of each individual character. The first book introduces us to a lot of people with Jacob as main character but they all get their time to shine now. It made me feel more connected to the storyline because they dont feel so distantly anymore. The way they have to work together to achieve their goal was nicely done. Its great when people need each other and how everyone plays their own role. The only downside is that I dont care a lot for Jacob and Im also not a fan of the sortofromance that is thrown into the story.  The ending was great and I want to know what is going to happen right now.    Great It was even better than the first book because of all the actionpacked scenes. Review will follow.;Ransom Riggs

I am speechless. The best feeling in the world when one of your most anticipated books of the year exceeds your expectations. Robin did it again and this series holds its rightful place on my favorite list of all time. I must admit that I wasnt blown away in the beginning but that changed soon. While Sybella will always be my favorite I really liked Annith.  This review is spoiler free for the entire series and book but if you still want to be careful I will give you one sentence to describe it This series is the perfect blend of sweet romance kickass yet flawed females action and history. I know I cant do this book justice with my words but I will try.  Annith is an unique nun assassins because she grew up in the covenant. She has trained all her life and she excels in every training. She is frustrated that everyone is send away on a mission while she is stuck with guiding new girls. When Annith finds out that the Reverend Mother is planning to make her the new seer she is tired of being obedient. She leaves the covenant to travel to the abbess in Guerande but on her road she comes into the presence of Balthazaar and his group of hellequins.  I wasnt a big fan of Annith in the beginning. I could understand her jealousy but I was getting tired of her whining. She already showed intelligence but it was a bit overpowered by her frustrations. It was amazing to see her develop through the story and how she hunts for answers. Its good that she breaks free from her blind faith in the covenant. She turned out to be a wonderful character with her own flaws and strengths. I especially admire the way she dealt with the lifechanging information she gets when the abbess finally confesses what is going on.  Her reunion with Sybella and Ismae was wonderful. I love how Robin connected all the stories and that we can see our previous assassins again. These three form a great cast and I cant get over how perfect this conclusion is to everyones story. We finally get all the answers to the Duchess problems and this politicalhistorical aspect has always been something I enjoyed in this series. Im happy to announce that Robin created a satisfying solution.  The romance is yet again a very good part of the book. Robin has a gift for writing balanced stories. It never takes over the plot but its essential for the story and important for Anniths development. Their mutual feelings are based on respect and friendship. It has enough time to make it feel realistic and it brought a smile to my face. I was surprised by Balthazaar and while it might be a bit cliched I was very pleased with their happilyeverafter. They arent my favorite couple in the series but you cant stop shipping them.  My advice put everything down run to the store and grab yourself a copy from Grave Mercy  Dark triumph and devour them before this pretty conclusion is published. You NEED to read this series. You want it in your life trust me. You can thank me later.  [image error]  EDIT  This book you guys. Its everything I wished for and even more. It exceeded my high expectations and its one of the best series conclusions Ive read this year  perhaps ever. The way all the stories come together and the combination of the wonderful romance  interesting Annith its just perfection.

I think all the comparisons to The Lunar Chronicles are doing this clever story an injustice. Fairytale retellings and books are bound to have similarities. Sure the scifi setting and certain elements could be connected with Marissa Meyers series but Stitching Snow is a story on its own and its a damn good one.  Essie has build a life on Thanda a cold unfriendly planet where she takes care of the drones and fights against the male miners to earn some extra money. Her life isnt perfect and with Dane crashing into her life things are bound to change. Dane portrays to be from Geramite looking for a treasure  and when Essie finds herself bound in a ship she finally figures it out she is the treasure. Essie isnt just a regular smart girl and Dane has found out about her secret.  Feelings cant be wasted. Knowing theyre real for however long they last makes them worth having.  Let me get started with feisty and spunky Essie. This girl doesnt take crap from anyone and she has managed to survive all on her own. Her loneliness is bearable with the help of her seven drones with Dimwit as the precious silly one. He has a couple of loose stitches but his loyalty to Essie is heartwarming. Her skills with electronics is admirable and I love how she turns every situation into something she can handle. There is no time to whine for her. Dane stole my heart. He did kidnap Essie but I felt he had all the right reasons to justify his actions and he does feel sorry for it in the end. Their dynamic is fun and his support is unfailing. It has also been a while since Ive seen such a healthy relationship in a YA retelling. The way he cares about Essie and thinks about her feelings is the best. The romance made me swoon and it was perfectly handled. Just enough time to make it plausible and it was never the focus of the story.  I think I am in love with you Essie. But I also think you are not ready. I shouldnt have sprung it on you like that so I decided to take it at your speed.  I was surprised by the depth and complexity that were woven into the plot. We get to see Essies escape and why Queen Octavia wants to have her killed. It took the original story line to another level. It was heavy material and I admired the authors bravery to use it and it worked.  The story was fastpaced I liked the writingstyle and the scifi setting with small details about the worldbuilding. I honestly dont get all the negative things I have heard about this book and I will cherish it. I cant wait for Spinning Starlight.;R.C. Lewis

I didnt know much about this book when I downloaded it from Edelweiss. I saw the cover and I really liked it. When I read the blurb I just went for it and Im happy I did My first experience with this author  Ive heard good things about her other series  was good.  This book is narrated from two POVs and that works perfect. It gives us the opportunity to connect with both characters and it makes it easy to understand whats going on. I think it was fundamental to see both of their stories and Im happy it worked out.  The first POV is about Haden. He is the disgraced prince of the Underrealm and he is picked by the Oracle to go to the mortal world to find his Boon. He must find Daphne and save his world. This girl is the Cypher and the only one who can find the Key to stop the possible destruction of the Underrealm and Mortal world. Its a huge responsibility for Haden and this is the way to prove to his father that he is worthy of his title as Prince next to his twin brother.  Haden is an interesting character. I liked to see how he tries to adjust to his life in the Mortal ream. There are new rules he has to follow and some things that were forbidden are now easy to access like music and emotions. I couldnt wait to find out what exactly happened when his father discarded him. Haden had a nice development and he went from an arrogant egoistic boy into someone who starts to care about other people. He starts to take more responsibility.  The second POV is of course about Daphne. She lives all her life in a tiny city with her mother uncle and strays her mother brought into her house. Daphne is dreaming of something more and a talent show feels like her way out. Before she can apply she is swept away by her father  who left them years ago  into a music program in Olympus Hills High. Its hard for Daphne to adjust to her new life especially when she is stalked by Haden. She has a gift for music especially singing and it was great to have a character with such passion and perseverance.  When their characters meet it was fun to see the story coming together. The mythology was subtle and I liked that we get to know Haden through Daphnes eyes. It made sure that we get to understand the real background story without an information dump. And seeing Daphne through Hadens eyes ensures that we understand his actions. The feelings between them are cute although a bit instaloveish and the ending was satisfying.  The reasons I gave this book 3 stars is that it can be a bit slow sometimes the characters arent the most memorable and there are cliches but despite this all I found myself enjoying this story. Perhaps a few pages less would benefit the pace because this book has a whopping amount of 512 pages. Im definitely looking forward to more.;Bree Despain

There were two reasons that made me excited to read this book 1. The cover because look at it Its gorgeous and 2. The whole boy sleeping in a glass coffin promise made me think this could be a little fairytaleish and I was right. The story holds a certain fairytale charm with its magical writing.  The darkest part of the forest is set in a town surrounded by a forest. If you are a passing visitor you have to be careful because the fae living in the woods like to play tricks with you. Every now and then people disappear to never return. Brave Hazel and her brother Ben decided to fight against these monsters until Ben fails to protect her. He decides their little game is to dangerous but Hazel isnt ready to give up. Instead the makes a dangerous deal with the fae.  The horned prince sleeping in the glass coffin has been an obsession for Hazel and Ben. They made up stories around him but they werent prepared for the true story. Hazels bargain has something to do with the prince and its vital they find him before the Alderking does. Hazel decides to ask help from Bens best friend Jack a Changeling and I love the explanations behind the prince and the clever nature of Hazels deal with the King.  I had mixed feelings about Hazel. I could understand her motives but I never really accepted them. I thought she was a bit too reckless and self destructive. She plays with emotions and runs away before she gets too attached. It was unfair to act like that and its so different from how I look at things that it was hard to feel sympathy for her. During the book I did warm up for her but she is not a character I fell in love with. I approved of her spirit when it comes to the fae and her royalty to her brother but thats about it. I was a bigger fan of Ben and Jack. Also credits for the natural way we find out that Ben is gay and how normal it was portrayed.  Like I said the story has a fairytaleish feeling to it. The writing had something magical every now and then. There was a solid plot but sometimes it was a little too slow. It was a good book but not something I would reread any time soon. I am however interested to read more by Holly Black.    I love the fairytale feeling. I love the plot but I wasnt so invested in the characters.

Lovetriangles rarely work for me but if it includes this type of romance.. Nope. Just nope.  I do love Peter Chris and Laras family.

This book is a delicious combination of weird unique and utter strangeness. I gave it 4 stars because the writingstyle didnt work for me. There was something about it that didnt click with me but towards the middle of the story I warmed up for it and the interesting promise kept me engaged. There was a moment in the beginning where I thought about quitting but Im happy I pushed through it.  Aza has a mysterious lung disease that is slowly killing her. People are always careful around the girl who has trouble to breathe except her best friend Jason. He introduces her to a phenomena called Magonia a world in the sky. Aza finds it hard to believe until she dies on earth and returns to her true form in Magonia. She is reunited with her birth mother who lives on a flying ship and who believes that Aza has special powers that will change Magonia forever.  And then out of fucking nowhere the bird flies into my mouth.  I can feel its tough little ones its claws scratching at my teeth. Im trying to scream but my mouths full of feathers. Its pushing and its wings are opening in my mouth en then in my throat and I cant breathe and then its down my windpipe and speaking from inside my chest.  This pretty much sums up what kind of story it is. This part was so messed up it gave me an itch in my stomach. Imagine how it must feel to have a freaking bird going from your mouth into your lung Not to mention having a special hole in your chest that opens and closes when it flies inout. It has been a while since I came across something bizarre like this and I loved it  The idea of flying ships and all the explanations behind nature forces was incredible. I loved the imaginative worldbuilding. The author knows how to deal with all the details it was never overwhelming. The information was perfect in balance with the rest of the story so it was easy to be swept away by her vivid Magonia. It was fastpaced and the plot was interesting.  I also liked Aza. She had some naive moments but I liked how she adopts to her new situation and how she always longs for her old life. It shows that being a mother and giving life to someone are two different things. Aza never stops thinking about her earthparents as her true mother and father. It was great to have such a loyal character. It also felt realistic that she wanted to impress her birth mother and that she looked for her approval despite all the flaws.  Azas dynamic with her best friend Jason was fantastic. Its obvious that the two feel more for each other and Jason is so sweet and understanding. Maria skips the whole instalove situation instead we have two people with a fantastic friendship who might be ready to become more. It was cute to see how they are both a bit scared to take the next step. Jasons mission to get Aza back was admirable. I also think it was a good decision to write a couple of chapters from Jasons POV. It added more depth to his character and it was interesting to see his perspective on the situation.  If you are looking for something creative and refreshing you might want to try Magonia.;Maria Dahvana Headley

Cleaving Threadsisters the way the Threads work and all the different types of Witchery it could use more explanations.  At the same time there isnt much of a plot. Safi and Iseult are mostly running around fleeing from enemies I didnt understand. Why are the countries out for war What is going on witb Aeduan Why is Safi so treasured for a power that doesnt seem so useful to me Like.. great you can tell truthlies but there are loopholes there and it doesnt gonna save you in battle. Id rather have a kickass almost undead Bloodwitch at my side like Aeduan.  Safi and Iseult.. I wasnt blown away by them and I also didnt feel their friendship. It felt more forced like they are MEANT to be close but just sticking around doesnt make me feel like you are the best friends ever. I wish we saw more things they have in common.  I did like Merik a lot. He was interesting and flawed with his fits of rage and his family struggles. I dont get his almost instantattraction with Safi but I do ship them so I wont complain too muvh about that.  Overall.. need more explanations and plot.;Susan Dennard

Enough said.  Edit  OH MY GOD. I HAVE IT IN MY HANDS RIGHT NOW. Im freaking out. I already love it. And yes that is possible. I know its going to be epic 3 Im almost afraid to read it now because I dont want to wait even longer for the other book.  edit 2 Done. This book is too good to be true. Its worth the wait. My review will be posted closer to the publication date but ahhhhhh. I want to fangirl happy dance. Marissa is a genius )  httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  You know you are reading a series by a very gifted author when she keeps delivering. This book was even better than I could hope for. Every character returns and the addition of the lovely Cress makes everything complete. l was swept away in the plot and the writingstyle is so flowy and easy. This series vaguely reminds me of Harry Potter every piece of information from the previous books seem to fall together and it makes me want to reread them to see if Ive missed anything before. I need Winter right now  Im overwhelmed by how good this book is but Ill try to capture the beauty and everything is spoiler free even if you havent read Cinder or Scarlet yet (and if thats the case shame on you what are you waiting for Im going to stare awkwardly and scary at you until you change it stares)  A little recap  In Cinder we meet a cyborg who finds out about her true identity. She befriends the new emperor Kai when her stepmother gives her up as test person in the search for a medicine against a deadly sickness.  In Scarlet things are only starting to get worse. There is Scarlet who is searching for her disappeared grandmother and on her way she meets Wolf. Cinder meets Thorne in prison and they manage to escape together. All these characters come together in the end and that brings us to Cress.  Kai is going to marry Levana Queen of Luna to save his people. Cinder is planning to do anything to stop that from happening but with Scarlets kidnapping Wolfs injuries and Thornes disappearing things are starting to look bad.  Review.  Let me start with the characters. They are awesome like always. Cinder is growing into her important role and I like how she keeps her head cool in difficult situations. Its admirable what she is planning to do especially when all her allies are gone or sick. We dont get to see much of Scarlet who is trapped in a horrible situation or Wolf who is most of the time brainwashed by Lunars or delusional because of his wounds. Despite the fact that I missed Scarlet I think it was a great decision it gives enough space to introduce us to Cress.  Cress has been living for seven years in a satellite hacking and programming under orders of Queen Levana. The only visits she gets are by her Mistress Sybel a woman who claimed she saved Cress when her parents discarded her. The thing I love about Cress is that she has been protecting Cinder and her friends because she knows its the right thing to do. She was a mixture of naivety braveness and weakness which made sense. If you grew up in solitude I think everyone would act the way she does. I found her quick adaptations to certain situations admirable and her romanticized look at life was adorable. Thorne was his charming self and I love his dynamic with Cress (still shipping him with Cinder though). I always imagine him looking like Flynn  tumblr_msimqtuxa71sfl9zxo1_250  Its hard to tell much about the plot without going into details (and therefore spoilers) so Im not going to try. The only thing I will say is that the series is very characterdriven something I absolutely love but there is also an intriguing plot. Every situation will keep you hooked to the story and the only two things you can think of is feelings and needtocontinue. Its quite a read with its 560 pages but let me tell you its never enough Cress is plotwise the strongest book in the series (so far).  It was a good blend of friendship romance action and explanations (especially when it comes to the worldbuilding). Like I said in the intro its fun to see how everything slowly comes together and Im very much looking forward to Winter. Let the wait begin..;Marissa Meyer

Cruel beauty is without a doubt one of my favorite retellings of all time. It was a highlight last year and I definitely set the bar high for this book. Unfortunately those high expectations werent met. It is still a great book dont get me wrong but it just didnt hit all the marks for me like Cruel beauty.  Let me start with all the things I did love.  The worldbuilding is good. I liked the setting and plot. The main idea is that there is a Forest that is filled with Forestbound. These people try to trick others so they can mark them. That leaves you with two choices die or kill someone and become bound too. The Forestbound want to claim the main character Rachelle as one of them so shell forget her human side entirely. That will happen soon enough when the Devourer is awakened. The idea of the Devourer gave this book a pressing atmosphere in combination with the random appearances of the creepy Forest.  Every day for the last three years she had thought she deserved to die. She still didnt want to. She wanted to live with every filthy desperate scrap of her heart.  Every day for the last three years she had thought she deserved to die. She still didnt want to. She wanted to live with every filthy desperate scrap of her heart.  Rachelle is like Nyx a broken and flawed character but they are in no way copies from each other. Rachelle cant live with the kill she made to survive her mark. She uses her power as Forestbound in the name of the King. She hunts down forest creatures as Bloodhound together with her partner Erec. She has no love for herself and that makes her reckless. Her selfhate was hard to see especially when we find out more behind the murder she committed. I loved that she redeemed herself in the end showing her true strength and courage. I also liked her friendship with Amelie.  Rachelle has to guard the bastard Prince Armand who claims that he survived the mark of a Forestbound without killing someone. It cost him both hands. He hides his stomps behind metal hands and everyone sees him as the Savior. Rachelle thinks he is a liar for no one can survive a touch by the Forest if they resist the urge to kill. Slowly she is wrapped up in Armands life and she finds out there is more behind his survival. In the mean time we see her trying to resist the pull from the Forest and her quest for a specific sword to stop the Devourer.  What I didnt like.  I thought the whole Red Riding Hood comparison was a bit far fetched. I kept waiting for the Wolf but there are only tiny tiny elements wrapped up in the storyline. I also didnt like the touch of a lovetriangle. I understand Rachelles pull towards Erec and Armand but I didnt connect with it. Armand was too bland for me and Erec was far too arrogant so both had no appeal to me. Their storylines were interesting though. I had no idea what to think about Erec and I liked finding out what was going on with Armand.  Its a book I will put on my shelves with pleasure (look at the cover) but I dont think I would reread it over and over again like I will with Cruel Beauty.;Rosamund Hodge

I had high expectations for Hidden Huntress after falling in love with Stolen Songbird and Danielle did a great job. This book doesnt suffer from the dreaded secondbooksyndrome. I didnt love it as much as Stolen Songbird but it was an engaging story . There are mild spoilers for Stolen Songbird.  This book picks up a few months after Stolen Songbird. Cecile lives with her mother in the city of Trianon while Tristan is suffering for his betrayal in Trollus. Ceciles mother is trying to make her a star but all she can think about is saving Tristan and her friends. To do so she must find the witch who cursed them under the mountain Anushka.  It is written from two POVs Tristan and Cecile. This was a great decision because we get to see both their stories and what is going on in the human  and Troll world. Tristan has been locked away but after Ceciles promise to find Anushka they release him. He still has to weir his shackles to prevent him from using magic but he can finally get in contact with some of his old friends. We get to see more of his father and the reasons behind all his decisions. It was interesting to see more of the villain because it gave him more complexity.  Ceciles story took some time to start. This made the beginning of the book a bit slow and I felt a bit disconnected from her. This changed halfway and this was the point I was sucked into the story. I love her strong personality and her loyalty towards Tristan and her Troll friends. She was naive when it comes to her mother but at the same time I could understand her feelings.  There were some nice twists in this story and some of them became obvious but Im still impressed with the buildup and conclusion. The ending is mean the story in the book is wrappedup but it leaves on a part where you just want to continue So despite the initial slow beginning I quickly fell in love and I highly anticipate the third book.;Danielle L.

The first book was really strong and I love how Stolen songbird changed the way I viewed trolls. Tristan and Cecile impressed me and I liked their chemistry. Hidden Huntress was a good sequel especially because it was written from both of their point of views. While warrior witch was a solid conclusion to the overall series it did not blow me away.  There was a change in TristanCeciles dynamic that made me annoyed by both of them. Their chemistry suffered from their constant need to keep things a secret to keep each other safe and I just wish they talked more. The plot was a bit slow with Cecile trying to make up for her mistake in the previous book but the ending made up for it. I did not see that coming and I thought it was fitting.

I thought it was a really clever wellwritten story with interesting characters. This was one of the books I read during the 24 hours readathon with my book club and it was not hard to read it in one sitting.  Nix sails together with her father on their ship The Temptation to any place in any time with the help of maps. I loved this concept although I wish there were more explanations around the maps. They must be new (no one must have used them to travel before) and I still dont really understand why. If some of them are so rare why not copy them before use Anyway they are looking for a very special map one where Nixs mother is still alive. This is a difficult matter for Nix because her mother died in childbirth and Nix has no idea what would happen if she travels to that time. It could erase her entirely but the complex relationship with her father makes her motivated to help him with his quest.  And boy did I love their dynamic. It is clear that her father is a troubled man who can think of only one thing finding the love of his life and getting her back. It is also obvious he loves Nix in his own way and it was great to have a book where a fatherdaughter relationship is the center where everything evolves around. His passionate search for this map makes sure that the plot takes us all to different places in the world in different time periods.  Another thing I really appreciated was the diversity in this book. The crew showcases many different people from other cultures and sexuality. Take Kash a Persian thief who is Nixs best friend. I am someone who does not need much romance in a book and I loved how Heidi handled this. Nix and Kash first start out as really good friends and not too much happens but that is what made me ship them so hard. Plus sass and banter  I think this book was a great start of a series and I very much look forward to the sequel.

It started out all right. Nihal was the leader of a group of children she was good at fighting and instead of becoming a wife she wanted to become a warrior and she did everything to become one.  The downside is that she really got on my nerves. Its good that the author made her cry and showed us that crying isnt weakness but damn Nihal has shed a LOT of tears. It got up to a point where I simply didnt feel anything when she started to cry again. She is also incredibly naive thought she was in love with a guy she hardly knew and she kept holding tight to those flimsy feelings and she was far too impulsive. This overshadowed the fact that she is strong and brave at times.  There are also a few losses but they all made me shrug. I wasnt invested enough in the story to feel anything.  The plot itself is also cliche. There is Tyrant he is battling Nihal is the last one of her species etc. I liked that there is no other romance only friendship between her and her onceenemywizardfriend and her relationship with her father and later on aunt was nicely portrayed.

Thanks to Harpercollins International for inviting me for their blog tour  (I see that the new blurb uses Graceling meets The Selection which seems to come closer to this book)  Mare Barrow has no job which means she needs to join the army once she turns eighteen. She is helping her family in the meantime by stealing something her working sister doesnt approve of. Mare feels she is always in the shadow of her younger sister a girl with a promising future. Thats until she gets a job in the Silver Palace where she ends up in a deadly game.  The worldbuilding was good. The population is divided between two people. We have the Reds people like you and me and the Silvers people with all kinds of powers. Reds live in poverty and they are inferior in the eyes of the Silvers. Their high status is maintained by the tyrant King and Queen who rule their country with an iron fist. They sacrifice the useless Red to keep a big army for their endless war. It was interesting to see how Mare tries to adapt to her new status when she is thrown into their midst.  Normally I would be a little bored by the middle of the book. Most of it is about Mare and how she learns to live like a Silver. We get to see her daily life filled with lessons and forced interactions with Silvers at social events. There are some nice turns but there isnt a lot going on. Victoria still manages to hook me to her tale I was sucked into the story she spun and I couldnt stop myself from turning the pages. This is one of the books where the plot shines because of the simplicity interesting turns and the compelling writingstyle.  I also really liked Mare. She is stuck between two personalities Mare and the girl she pretends to be. This struggle was wellwritten and it made me admire her even more. Just the fact that she adapts doesnt mean she is ready to give up the real Mare. They cant break her spirit. She is strong brave and loyal. It first seemed to turn into a main character who is more powerful and special than others but Victoria steers away from that cliche in a believable way. There is only thing that make me question the story about how they were able to keep up this charade. How is it that NOBODY discovers that her blood is red You cant tell me that Mare never bleeds..  I also liked the other characters. There is a big cast but most of the emphasis is on the two princes her best friend and family members. It was good that these played a role in the story they dont disappear. Mare is always worried about them and that felt realistic. Some of them are more than what they seem Victoria caught me with surprise every now and then.  The funny thing is that I started to ship Mare with different characters and that doesnt happen very often to me. Romances annoy me most of the times but I was delighted how Victoria deals with it. Its on the background and is subtly interwoven into the plot. You could say it has a touch of a lovetriangle but it was not bothersome to me (but I want Kilorn dead). Best of it no instalove  And the last thing I cant forget I loved the different powers Victoria came up with some of them are quite original. I think some of them would come in handy I cant wait to see more of these powers in the sequel a book Im highly anticipating now.;Victoria Aveyard

Her father makes the proclamation to all Eurona kill the creature and you can marry Aerity.  For some reason she is immediately intrigued by the brooding local hunter Paxton Seabolt. He is there with the hunt to protect his people and mostly his brother who is certain he is going to marry the princess. They come from a poor family and he believes this is the best way to solve all their worry. Paxton keeps up the illusion of hating Aerity and everything she stands for but at some point he is captured by her.  The romance between Paxton and Aerity really comes out of the blue. She meets his eyes and he is suddenly the only one she can think of. He hates her but without getting to know her he suddenly changes his opinion about her.. While I liked the fact that it is a hatetolove situation I simply did not like how it all started.  The last part of the book was a bit too repetitive and that made it a little boring. I had a feeling we were being told the same time multiple times and I didnt see any character development during that period. I think the plot could have used some more story and personal growth.  The ending was quite good though and I look forward to see how it all comes together in the sequel.  Overall not a bad book and I want to read the sequel but it had potential to be awesome and it did not reach that status for me.;Wendy Higgins

I wouldnt say this book is vital but I liked seeing more about this villain and how she became the person she is today.  Her story is a sad one.

People talk behind her back and there is only one person who make her feel loved Evret from the guard. Levana starts a crazy obsession with him daydreaming about a life together with him and overthinking his actions. It felt pity for her and she spiraled down so fast. Her hunger for power but most of all acceptance from her people consumes her and drives her to undertake terrible actions.  Do I understand Levana Not at all.  Do I think she is a sympathetic character Not at all.  Do I agree with any of her choices Not at all.  But at the same time I could see where it all came from. She is such an unstable personality with an all consuming madness. Things could have turned out differently if she was brought up in a caring family. Her parents death and her sisters constant bullying played a big role in the person Levana became  and I feel sorry for the woman she could have been.;Marissa Meyer

Our Dragon doesnt eat the girls he takes no matter what stories they tell outside our valley. We hear them sometimes from travelers passing through. They talk as though we were doing human sacrifice and he were a real dragon. Of course thats not true he may be a wizard and immortal but hes still a man and our fathers would band together and kill him if he wanted to eat one of us every ten years. He protects us against the Wood and were grateful but not that grateful.  This story is a perfect blend of several folktales and Beauty and the beast. I was highly entertained by Agnieszka and the creepy Wood that is starting to get more powerful by the day. Despite some minor issues I fell in love with the writingstyle plot and characters.  Every 10 year the Dragon comes down to the village in the valley to claim another girl. Nobody knows what happens to them but they never return the same they are wild and educated ready to see the world instead of settling down like the rest of them. Everyone knows Kasia will be taken next best friend from Agnieszka. Imagine her surprise when the Dragon takes her.  He is not at all what she expected and to be honest also not what I thought. The Dragon is an attractive guy who wants to teach Agnieszka how to use her new discovered magic instead of a firebreathing creature. The two of them have to work together against the power of the Wood before it swallows the whole country in its wickedness.  Agnieszka was delightful. Forget about perfect beautiful girls and welcome her in your life. She is clumsy and nothing special. She always trips she cant keep her clothes clean and trouble seems to be attached to her. Her appearance are never written down as noteworthy and I loved her unruly hair and ordinary looks. She has a strong spirit quick mind and despite her shyness knows how to stand up for herself in times of need. It was fun to see her grow into her power and to discover she has her own kind of magic.  The Dragon is a mysterious insulting guy who has no patience for Agnieszka and all the trouble she gives him. He always snaps at her but underneath that is someone who is clearly worried about his people. His perfectionism stands in his way and I laughed because of his struggle when it comes to his feelings for Agnieszka. The only problem I had was the fact he felt really distant to me. I wish I got to see more of his emotions which made me romance a little bland. They had chemistry but it could have used some extra spark. On the other hand there is one steamy scene that showed promise. I just wish there was more so that I would have shipped them harder.  The plot is interesting and has a rather creepy setting. It was very vivid and detailed without being too overly descriptive. There is the Woods a place where monsters roam around ready to snatch people away. When someone gets in contact with the Woods they turn corruptive and they will kill everyone in their way. I loved the plot around this place and how Agnieszka is willing to sacrifice herself to save her friend Kasia when she has been taken. It could have used more pace every now and then but I was captivated by the writingstyle and the question what will happen next  The last thing I want to address is the friendship between Agnieszka and Kasie. It was wonderful. These girls support each other no matter what. There is a healthy amount of jealousy between them which made it realistic and I love how their friendship is featured throughout the story. It made me appreciate Agnieszka even more and Kasia herself is a pretty interesting character as well.  Do you like folklore Do you like dark settings and grim fairytales This is definitely a book for you.;Naomi Novik

Monsters magic and dangerous situation this book has it all I would recommend to read it together with your child if shehe gets easily scared because it could give them some nightmares.  Kara and Taf are a great duo. I always love to read about brothersister relationships and their voice sounded genuine with their age. I never felt I was reading a book written by an adult Kara and Taf acted like their age.  Kara is a strong intelligent girl and a good role model. She takes care of her brother and she knows how to make the best out of every situation. Things get pretty messy when they are captured by Sorin who wants Kara to release him from his connection to The Thickety  so he can roam the earth and spread more chaos.  Taf is exactly how I imagine every little boy a bit naughty and he looks up to his sister. His quick mind comes in handy in many situation and I love his nativity. It gave his character a lot of charm.  Sorin was an interesting villain and I love the unexpected twist.

I always like it when authors try to use several fairytales but the stories dont connect. The authors throws one after the other into the story without really tying it together. It was a bit too much for my taste.  The basic of the story was interesting. Alice is in therapy and has to take pills to take control of her wild imagination. Until she is kicked right back into Wonderland by White Rabbit. Wonderland isnt the same anymore. Ace of Spades has taken over the power and takes the Wonder out of everyone and the world he wants to create something similar as Alices modern world. White Rabbit wants to stop this process. Alice ends up being sent to Wonderland to collect an army. Together with Peter Pan she must awaken the Sleeping Beauty in Grimms country ruled by Queen Charming.  A lot of characters are thrown into it. We have Captain Hook who turns out to be Gepetto and the ticking crocodile is actually Pinocchio. There is Rumplestiltskin who acts as seer for Queen Charming (Cinderella) who is actually the mother of rebel Snow White. She has joined forces with Robin Hood and his merry man. When the war starts in Wonderland we also suddenly see Hercules and I just couldnt keep track of them anymore. It was overwhelming and it didnt blend together nicely.  This made it hard to connect with any of the characters because they werent fleshed out not even Alice. She is not a quitter and I like that but at the same time she doesnt really have a reason to save Wonderland. Her I just want to speech to rouse an army wasnt spectacular.  Its a shame really.;David D. Hammons

This book isnt as good as the first one. It took me a lot of time to get into it but the overall story was good enough to make me want to pick up the sequel.  1. Kelsea is an interesting character. She is really flawed. Her obsession with appearances can be annoying but I guess its something she got from her mother. I like how there is a darker side in her and that she admits to it. Most of the times MCs are portrayed as these perfect characters who always go with the good side but she sometimes steps into a grey area.  2. We see more of the Red Queen and maybe its me but I was surprised by her true identity. The author tries to give her some sort of justification for her actions but lets face it she is just a terrible person.  3. Lilys POV felt a bit unnecessarily for the overall story but at the same time she had an impressive life. She suffers from physical and emotional abuse by her husband but she is in a time where she feels forced to stay with him. But for a reason it just didnt seem to fit together with Kelseas story. It gives more background about the worldbuilding (which was confusing especially in the first book) but I think the author could have handled that information in another way too.  4.

LOOK AT THAT COVER. This has to be the most disappointed book Ive read this year because I was expecting so much. Even after some negative reviews I kept holding on to the hope that I might like it after all because we all know how much I love my fairytales. And again that cover is stunning so I was hoping the story would live up to it. Now let me go sit in a corner and weep while you read my review of this book with potential  and managed to blow it.  The story started all right. I liked the writing the characters were interesting and the steampunk details definitely added something unique to the original tale. Unfortunately the characters soon became annoying and shallow. The steampunk soon lost its charm because it became overwhelmed by Nicolette and her endless blabber.  There was a point in the story where I lost it. I couldnt handle the oh we meet 5 minutes and we shall be best friends for life and the I am in love with you because we have conversations in my head situations.  Besides I didnt think it mattered much. I knew we could talk to each other knew we liked each other  and it seemed I would talk with Fin in my mind whether I wanted to or not.  The essentials of the story are still there. Two mean stepsisters a beautiful yet cold stepmother and a Prince wanting to get a wife. There is even some talk of magic and forbidden fairies after the death of their beloved Queen. This topic is hardly handled and doesnt seem to serve a true purpose for the story. Its about Nicolettes whining after all. She had clever moments where she used her mothers talent by fixing mechanical objects but mweh.  Then the ending. Gosh. That was frustrating. It simply didnt work for me. Im not sure how much you would count as a spoiler but let me say that its not the expected happilyeverafter the story is working towards. Fin starts out as a charming guy but then the basically tells her he also has loved someone else his entire life and he still proposes to Nicolette I would tell him to go to hell so credits for Nicolette that she turns him down but I found it unbelievable since she has been telling us for over 120 pages how much she loves him.  To be honest Im so let down I dont even want to write a review about it. Sorry for this rambling mess but I am terribly disappointed.;Betsy Cornwell

I fell in love with Prisoner of night and fog. Anne wrote such an engaging story and she managed to do the same with Conspiracy of blood and smoke. Her research resulted in an interesting story about the rise of Hitler. Most historical books take place in World War II so I love the setting where we see how Hitler takes over with his charisma and sneaky manipulation.  Gretchen and Daniel have fled Germany and are trying to set up a new life in England until Daniel gets a note that his beloved nephew is in the hospital and he returns to Germany. Gretchen receives a message telling her that Daniel is wanted for murder she returns to save him.  I loved the tension in this story. They are both wanted by Hitler for different reasons. Gretchen is a traitor of the worst kind and Daniel is the dirty Jew who tries to spread lies. They are both in danger being in Germany but Daniel cant rest until the world knows the truth about Hitler the recent fire in the Reichstag and the murder on an innocent girl who knew to much. I think its admirable he is willing to sacrifice his life for the greater good. Im not sure I would be unselfish enough to do the same. Gretchen is also strong and I appreciate that she sticks with Daniel. He has given her several ways out to protect her but she is always by his side. That is true love to me.  Both characters have a good development especially Gretchen changed a lot in comparison with the beginning of Prisoner of night and fog. From someone who loved Hitler growing up with him as Uncle Dolf to opposing him to save the Jews is a huge change. Anne wrote this in a very believable  subtle way. I never felt her switch to the other side was too fast. Daniel is a sweetheart and you can see his love for Gretchen in all his actions and words.  The plot might not be 100 accurate but it did feel authentic. The unrest under the people and the chaos Hitler uses to press for more power resonate throughout the whole story. The worldbuilding was wellbalanced and I liked the setting. The mystery around the fire and murder and how we slowly unravel whats the reason behind them was nicely done. It shows Hitlers madness and intelligence to use certain situations for his own good.  The only thing that let me down was the predictability. Sometimes it felt like Gretchen and Daniel got off too easy it was a bit too convenient for the story but nevertheless a great book.;Anne Blankman

Cat Winters has been on my favorite list ever since I read In the shadow of blackbirds. She followed up with the fantastic The cure for dreaming and The uninvited. The Steep and Thorny way did not fail to impress me and Cat continues to blow me away.  Hanalee Denney is the daughter of a white mother Greta and an African father Hank. Her father died in an accident caused by Joe Adder and her mother remarried Clyde Koning the doctor who treated her father the night he died. When Joe is released from prison Hanalee pays him a visit with a gun to get her revenge but instead she returns home with information that change everything.  This book a reimagining of Hamlet is set in a time where the Klu Klux Klan is spreading hate through Oregon. Both Hanalee and Joe have a lot to fear from them especially when Hanalee finds out that her father wasnt killed by the accident. Joe told her that he did not kill Hank but that something else is going on and Hanalee is set to find out what truly happened that night. There is also has a LGBTQI subplot which creates a powerful story with a paranormal touch.  Cat is a master in creating strong heroines and Hanalee is no exception. She is a brave fierce girl who will not rest until she figures out why her father was killed. I did not feel a lot of connection with Joe but his subplot added more tension and truly shows the reach and effect of hatred from closeminded people.  I felt like the supernatural aspect could have been more prominent but overall it was a perfectly blended into the story. It is also obvious that the author again did a lot of research before writing this book and I love that they continued to use old photographs. It definitely sets her books apart from others together with her signature writingstyle. Highly recommended.    Everything Winters write is magical ) Loved it;Cat Winters

But thenas every good adventure beginsthe king swoops into port and Jonathan and his father are enlisted to find the cure to a deadly plague. Jonathan discovers that hes a prodigy at working with a new chemical called fantillium which creates shared hallucinationsor illusions. And just like that Jonathan is knocked off his path. Through richly developed parallel worlds vivid action a healthy dose of humor and gorgeous writing Heather Dixon spins a story that calls to mind The Night Circusand Pixar movies but is wholly its own.;361;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1413484726m22840398.jpg;Illusionarium;fantasy paranormal;httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I wanted to love this. I really did. Heather Dixon is the author from Entwined and that turned out to be one of my favorite retellings from that particular fairytale (The twelve dancing princesses). I was so stoked when I saw the announcement of her new book but it wasnt what I expected. At all. The whole concept of illusions aerial cities and parallel words sounded amazing but it was confusing to me. I still dont get how the illusions work and there is something about it that doesnt feel right.  You have to be under the influence of some kind of drug you can create things out of thin air by building it with the right elements if you have the right gift. Only people under influence can see your creations. This was an interesting idea but then we get an explanation that those items come from parallel worlds and I got lost.  If you can illusion something identical to another world you can somehow manipulate the physics of the world into thinking it belongs to the other world.  You create something that isnt there because its an illusion but at the same time its real I just didnt understand the parallel worlds and how people are able to travel between them.The explanations fell short on TRULY explaining what was going on and it doesnt make sense if you scientifically look at it.  I like that the book is written from the POV of a boy called Jonathan but he doesnt necessarily feels like a boy. If we would have switched his name to lets say Joan it would have been the same. I never felt I got to know him. He stays flat and has no characteristic personality traits although I like how loyal he was to his family.  I liked the sickness that is spreading which all started the Illusionarium business but I wish we got more information about it. Perhaps its just me and my love for medical things but I wanted an explanation why it only targeted women and not men I want prove that the author thought about those tiny details.  I have to give Heather points for creativity and the fact that there is no overwhelming romance whatsoever. Jonathan has some feelings for a girl but he is far too busy with the fact that important people are getting sick  that he is stuck in another world. That gives his personality some credits because far too often we see people falling in love  and then they forget about what truly matters. The ending wraps everything up in a nice way but mweh. Im disappointed. I will still keep an eye out for new work by the author because she knows how to write but I hope she returns to the quality of Entwined.;Heather Dixon

In My Lady Jane coauthors Cynthia Hand Brodi Ashton and Jodi Meadows have created a oneofakind fantasy in the tradition of The Princess Bride featuring a reluctant king an even more reluctant queen a noble steed and only a passing resemblance to actual historybecause sometimes history needs a little help.At sixteen Lady Jane Grey is about to be married off to a stranger and caught up in a conspiracy to rob her cousin King Edward of his throne. But those trifling problems arent for Jane to worry about. Jane is about to become the Queen of England.;491;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1444923765m22840421.jpg;My Lady Jane (The Lady Janies 1);history historical fiction biography;This book gave me mixed feelings. When I started it I thought it was simply brilliant. But the further I got into the story the more I fell out of love with it. In the end it became simply one of those enjoyable stories that was nothing special.  I was and still am a big fan of Jane though. The way the authors created her character was brilliant and she was my spirit animal. She loved reading tried to stay away from parties and when she had to attend she was not a social butterfly. I could totally see myself getting friends with her so we could rave about books and be awkward in groups together.  Edward shows great progress throughout the story. He grew up with the same knowledge as every man in that time period girls were pretty much useless. Their only worth was marrying them off to someone powerful and rich  and that is exactly what is going to happen to Jane. Edward need to secure his line on the throne because he is dying so if Jane gets children in time they can be put on the throne.  Her mother has tried to marry off Jane on multiple occasions and all of them failed so Jane is not scared in the beginning. But the further we get the more serious it is starting to become  and Jane really dislikes Gifford and his reputations. The problem for Gifford is that he spends his days as a horse and only returns to his human form in the night. He is unable to control his powers. The two of them grow together and that was definitely the highlight of this book.  It was fun. It was good but not as mindblowing as it was in the beginning )    I really loved it in the beginning.  And then suddenly I didnt  I dont know why it went wrong but somewhere half way I fell out of love with it. It became simply okay and not too bad. I need more time to think about this.;Cynthia Hand Brodi Ashton Jodi Meadows

I LOVE IT. 4.5 stars.  EDIT httpthedailyprophecy.blogspot.nl2...  I heard a lot about Dangerous girls so I added the books on my wish list and didnt look at it again. Luckily Ellis send me a copy and right after finishing Dangerous boys I ordered Dangerous girls. What a mindfuck I was very satisfied how this story was told and how it tied together in the end.  This story is told in a then and now perspective. The story starts in the now where Chloe is in the hospital. One body is found in a burning cabin one boy has been brought into the hospital with serious injuries and she is unable to tell what happened.  Most of the book takes place in the then where we get to see how Chloe and Ethan get into a relationship. Chloes life is a mess. Her plans for the future have changed she must take care of her unstable mother and she has to juggle several jobs to keep the bills paid. Ethan is the only positive thing in her life but soon she gets entangled in his brothers life (Oliver).  From the beginning on I didnt know how I felt about Chloe. Her character isnt written to be liked we simple get to see how she deals with a situation thats getting out of hand. I didnt feel connected to her but I felt pity for her when her life starts to crumble and I was engaged in her life. It was complicated to understand her emotions and decisions but her unreliable perspective was fascinating. I cant go too much into details here but Chloe gets under your skin.  Ethan and Oliver are the complete opposites. Ethan was a bit too sweet for my taste but Oliver was definitely not my cup of tea with his badboy vibe and brutal way of thinking. I didnt care for either of the boys but thats not what this book is about. There is a certain distant from all the characters because the story is completely focused on the plot and the mystery about what happened  and better who survived I wasnt let down by the answers and Im very excited about Dangerous girls.  The last thing I want to share is that this book is filled with beautiful quotes that were spot on. This quote is my favorite From the moment you are born people start folding you and tucking you inside a box of their own design. They dress you up in their own expectations before you even have a chance to understand the constrictions of your fate. That box becomes so cozy and warm you never really notice that youre bent double fighting for room to breathe.;Abigail Haas

This my friends is how you write a sequel and I love that Meadows decided to go with a duology which fits with the story and how it all ended. She made me fall in love with every character because they are all complex and they all have their own motivations. I also really appreciate how she gave everyone a hard time. There are no rainbows and butterflies in this story I can tell you that.  There are no spoilers for the first book.  The story picks up right after that cliffhanger from the Orphan queen. Wilhelmina does everything in her power to help her people and that is how her two worlds start to blend together. Wil faces a new unexpected enemy who is raising an army to take their country back so he can set Wil back on the throne. Wil wants to do it peacefully until they reach a point in the story where she is forced to reveal her true identity.  I love how every page count. There was not a moment where I felt the story slacked. Every sentence mattered and we are thrown in a story where we see Wil struggle with multiple aspects of her life.  1. She does not know how to be Wilhelmina the Queen.  2. The people are rioting.  3. Someone is using violence in her name.  4. The Wraith is coming closer.  5. Her romantic feelings are a mess.  The fact that there are so many things that bug her and she still manage to stand up and fight made me admire her. I fell in love with Wil and her clever strong and brave attitude. She is confused and afraid but I think she did one hell of a job. She was a realistic character. I also liked her dynamic with other characters and how her feelings for a specific person grew. There is no focus on romance and definitely no loveatfirstsight which made this book even better.  There were also some interesting twists and turns especially surrounding one character that tugged at my heart around the ending. If you love fantasy definitely give this one a go;Jodi Meadows

Edit  I want to give my short thoughts about this incredibly frustrated book. When I requested it I was hoping for an interesting mystery. There is certainly something going on but its hidden behind the endless switches between characters that all sound the same  and of course they have to be a cliche.  Paolo the popular guy who knows he looks good uses his charm for money. Lucy the punkrock girl with a talent for playing guitar catches his eyes and suddenly he is in love. We have the stepsisters Candace and Grace and for some reason I couldnt keep them apart. Those names blend together after a while but perhaps its also because I didnt care for either of them. I believe Candace is the wannabe TV star and Grace writes letters to people on death row. There is Maya with a hidden agenda Johnsomething who is the typical gay boy and I believe that is it.. They are emancipated which means their parents let go of them for some reason and they all live together in a house in Venice Beach.  It was hard to keep track of everyone and every chapter is sortofwritten from a different POV with a narrative perspective. I dont really get the idea behind this it is only confusing. They could all die for all I care. I only finished this because I wanted to find out what was going on with all of these characters  who all happen to have a secret. We couldnt put a normal character there imagine how boring that would be And what a surprise they end up in the same house. Not to forget the fact that one of the girls has been looking for someone who SUDDENLY lives in the room next door. What a coincidence  And at the end you dont know shit because the book just stops in the middle of nowhere without promise of a sequel. Some stories provided some more information but there are too many lose threads and ugh. I dont even want to read the sequel but at the same time it forces you to read it.  Just stay away from this one.;M.G. Reyes

This book was not what I expected and thats in a positive and negative way. I enjoyed it but at the same time Im still not sure how I feel about the conclusion when it comes to the romance. The plot is a bit slow but I was happy they returned to the dark Wonderland and all its creepy creatures. Its a solid story.  The review is spoiler free for Ensnared but contains small spoilers for the previous books.  Alyssas journey started in Splintered and finally comes to an ending in this conclusion. I liked how she developed and accepted her new role as Queen. Shes no longer just a human but she has learned to embrace her Wonderland side and responsibilities. The insecure girl from Splintered has grown into a woman with an important role for both worlds  and Howard handled that with care. I wouldnt say that I always appreciated her choices and her continuous struggle between MorpheusJeb got on my nerves but shes an overall good character.  Morpheus stays true to his manipulative and sassy nature. Im going to stick with my previous opinion I like him as a character but not as loveinterest. He is complex and unpredictable which adds a great touch to the story. I definitely believes he loves Alyssa in his way but I dont find it healthy or shippable. He is still a better choice than Jeb who continues to prove why I dislike him. I could understand why he acted so distantly because Alyssa made some poor decisions but he wasnt fair. He could accept Morpheus as a new friend but he never gave Alyssa a chance and he has a nasty attitude that made a bigger mess in an already outofcontrol situation.  Unhinged was a bit disappointing because I missed Wonderland but thats not the case in Ensnared. We get to see Wonderland from another angle when Alyssa and her father go on a quest to save Jeb and Morpheus. The two of them are working together to survive the darkness that is taking over. Their newfound friendship was refreshing and I liked Jeb magical powers.  The only thing that let me down was the plot. Its slow. It struggled to move forward and got stuck in some situations which provided me with some boring moments. I felt there was too much emphasis on Alyssas feelings towards the guys instead of the destruction of Wonderland. I still like the concept and the basics of the plot but it could have used some more work in my humble opinion.  That leaves the ending.  MINOR SPOILER Im not giving away details but dont read it if you want to know nothing like Jon Snow.  Im seriously still inconclusive how I feel about this. One part of me likes the creativity because I dont think this has done before. One part of me feels like its an easy way out to keep everybody happy. I just.. dont know.  So I have mixed feeling about this series as a whole. Im not blown away but I appreciate what the author tried to do with the original tale. Would I recommend this series to everyone I would say Ive read better retellings but hardcore Alice in Wonderland fans might approve of this series.;A.G. Howard

I could understand her frustrations because the others were just plain stupid but it would have been smarter to keep them close.  There is also Lucky who has a severe case of possessiveness over Cora when he finds out what their main goal is. He started out okay but soon turned into a creep. He completely lost his mind and I didnt care about his fate. I also hope the author doesnt turn him into one of the loveinterests because that romance is even more doomed to fail than the other option. There are also some other teenagers but to be honest I forget their names (that is how impressive they are)  The story is inconsistent. Cassian and Cora was just a big fat no. I did like the writingstyle and the idea but it failed to deliver. The ending was okay but the overall story isnt good enough for me. I think its time for me to say goodbye to Shepherds work. We just dont click.;Megan Shepherd

It was quite obvious in the beginning that I would not get along with this book. Its definitely a case of its me not you because this book has a lot to offer. For some reason though I did not connect with the story the characters or the writing.  Jamie Watson got a rugby scholarship to Sherringford where Charlotte Holmes goes to school as well. The two of them meet and he is immediately impressed by her Charlotte less. She likes to be by herself in her laboratory but Jamie feels an attraction to her and the two of have to work together when they are being set up. A student dies under strange circumstances and they are both seen as suspects  and only Charlottes intelligence can clear their names.  I liked the fact that Holmes is a girl now. She is smart impulsive and confident three trades I normally really like in a character. With Charlotte it was the opposite I disliked her could not connect with her and most of all I had a hard time accepting her drugs abuse. She got on my nerves more often than I wished and even her hard times did not make me like her more.. The way she looks at life and treats certain situations just did not work for me.  I had the same with Jamie. He felt blank to me and I never had the feeling I was connected to him. There was no sparkle for me and the two lacked the chemistry I see in the TV show and movies. I guess it is because they only work together because someone is trying to frame Charlotte and Jamie is pulled under as well.  The way they put the clues together was kind of fun but the overall mystery was not that exciting to me and the lack of emotions made this a failure for me.    This was definitely a case of it is me not you. I can see why a lot of people liked this book but I simply did not click with it. I didnt like the characters and the mystery did not do it for me.

This book was so much fun. Lorelei is a strong kickass girl and I liked the fastpacing of the plot. I can not wait to see what other stories the author comes up with because I always look forward to fairytale retellings with brave girls.  Lorelei and Leo Crown princess and Crown prince of Ravenspire ran away from their stepmother Queen Irina together with their guard Gabriel. They both have magic and they want to get their kingdom back when the time is right. I liked that they had a plan and that they worked to become strong enough to beat her. They didnt throw themselves in a useless fight because it was obvious they were not ready yet to battle Irina. I liked their dynamic with Gabriel who became their father figure after the death of the King.  Kolvanisimir Arsenyevnek also Kol is the new King of Eldr. He needs to make a deal with Queen Irina for help in his war against the ogres. He is a Draconia which means he is able to shapeshift into a Dragon. This was such a cool addition to the story and I liked that this friends were able to shapeshift as well. I always hate the cliche where the main characters are special or more powerful he is simply one of many. He meets Lorelei and her brother without knowing who they really are and that gives many obstacles later on. Kol must hunt down the princess in order to get Irinas help and he accepts until he finds out it is Lorelei.  What I loved about this book is how it did not shy away from making brutal choices. I liked the twists and turns in the story. Lorelei is a strong brave girl who is capable of making intelligent choices. I liked her dynamic with Kol and how they did not immediately fell in love. There is time to build up their character and interest in each other which made it not hard to ship them together. They both have to endure a lot and that gave them something important in common.  Irina was a powerful wellcrafted villain and she was that type you love to hate. There are parts that feature her and I liked her dontgiveacrap attitude. She is merciless and the author managed to make her a character instead of a typical caricature villain.  Never assume that because you sometimes share my bed you are also share my throne. You are dismissed.;C.J. Redwine

I was blown away by the story I felt all the pain and suffering from the characters and I grew to love their relationship even more.  Shahrzad is forced away from her beloved husband the Caliph of Kohorasan our beloved Khalid. In the first book we see her going into the marriage with vengeance in her heart but over time she met the real Khalid and found out his story. She has now fallen in love with him but a curse is threatening to keep them apart. Shazi is reunited with her family and is now trapped between two loyalties the one to her husband and the one to her best friend who commands a force set to destroy Khalids empire.  SO MANY FEELINGS. I fell from one emotion into the other. The entire story was one rollercoaster with twists and turns that made me fear for both Shazi and Khalid. I did like the fact we get to spend time with them separately. This way we get to see more of Shazis family like her sister and Rahim and Artan who is helping her understand her magic. We also have Despina back and her subplot was fantastic as well.  Another thing I absolutely love is the gorgeous writingstyle from Ahdieh. She swept me away with her almost poetic choice of words and there are SO many quotable sentences that I gave up on using sticky marks.  Definitely one of my favorite duologies EVER.    THAT WAS FABULOUS.  holds the precious  Everything I could have wished for  and more. What an emotional rollercoaster. I started this book today and I finished it in one sitting.

It took me a long time to read this book. I love the unique formatting and how this book is like anything Ive ever read before but at the same time it made this the type of story I could not read in one sitting. It was a book that made me want to read a couple of pages before moving on to something else. That does not mean it was bad not at all. I was hooked to the story especially towards the ending where everything seems to be doomed but it took me on a longer journey than other books.  This interesting way of telling a story was brilliant. Big credits to the overall design and how it eventually came together as a story. In the beginning I felt like I was floating around all kinds of stories different pieces of information and nothing seemed to be connected until it all came together. I really started to enjoy it the moment it started to make more sense.  I LOVED the virus (surprise) and the tension it added. The people with the Phobos virus were terrifying and I never thought there would be so many tense and scary situations especially when Kady tries to save the day. This girl was so brave and intelligent I really admired her strength. The downside was my disconnection from her. Despite liking her I never felt I truly got to know her because of this formatting. I also wasnt a fan of her chat conversations with Ezra. They both had a funny voice but there is just something about chats that doesnt work for me. This also gave me a certain dontcare attitude towards their romance I didnt ship them that much.  The ending was a bit disappointing. I first thought the authors were brave by the twist they pulled but then they decided to go with the ohsocliched untwist and mweh I wish they had stayed true to the story bleak dark and many deaths. I am curious about the sequel and I cant wait to see how the story continues but I dont think Im as much in love with this book as everyone else.

This book did not turn out to be as epic as I thought it would be in the beginning. After a couple of pages I declared on Goodreads that this book would definitely end up in my top 10 of 2016. After finishing Im not sure if it will get a place but it was highly enjoyable and I do recommend it. Also the map is at the end of the book. No idea who came up with that idea but all the way through the book I was thinking I need a map to visualize this world So imagine my surprise when I found it at the end.. Im happy they have one but it is a strange placement.  Rapunzel has a quiet life in her tower where she is cared for by Witch the only mother she knows. Witch makes sure she is safe from the scary outside world where princess try to marry her for her looks. No one has been able to reach to Rapunzel as far as she knows until Jack climbs into her tower. Jack only wants to find a cure for the fairy realm so in return they can help him with his Giant problem. He helps her find out that there is more behind Witch than Rapunzel thought and she ends up leaving her tower for a quest.  Rapunzel was terribly naive and while I get that she might be more innocent than the average girl at some point it started to get on my nerves. I liked how she cared for Witch despite finding out what she has done. It was understandable and I always appreciate it when people can find something good in others. I also think she had a point when it comes to her birth parents.  Jack was a nice boy and I liked his mission to save his family. He had a hard time putting up with Rapunzel and I loved their bickering. The best thing about Middle Grade is always the fact they portray friendship between girls and boys without feeling the need to turn it into a romance. I think this book will appeal to younger girls who will be less distracted by Rapunzels naive behavior.    It might not have turned out as THE epic book I expected in the beginning when I said this book would be in my top 10 of favorite books this year but it certainly was really good. I had so much fun with this story and the characters )  Review to come.;Megan   Morrison

I already knew that V. Schwab knows how to write an engaging story. I enjoyed both The near witch and The archived. This book took writing to another level. I am amazed by her creative worldbuilding and her fascinating characters. If you are a fantasy lover I highly recommend this book (and if you are new to the genre you might want to pick this up too)  The worldbuilding was a bit difficult to understand at first with all the different versions of London and some new fantasy names that Schwab created. But it didnt take long before I was sucked into this unique concept and her great execution.  The basics of the story are three versions of London and once people were able to transport between them. The portals were destroyed with the loss of Black London and now only Kell and one other Antari are able to travel between these worlds. He is the messenger of the leaders from these London versions and on one of his appointments he stumbles on Delilah also known as Lilah a crosseddressed thief and aspiring pirate.  It was amazing how Schwab created all these versions of London. It was easy to pinpoint out where Kell was at times because they all have their distinct feeling. I would prefer to live in Red London where Kell comes from. He grew up in the royal family and he has an interesting relationship with his brother Rhy. I loved Kell and his special talents. Kell has a mysterious air around him and it was interesting to riffle through his different personality traits. He is a very complex character and I have a feeling I dont know anything about him yet which makes me so excited for the sequel.  He has a wonderful dynamic with Lilah a girl who stole my heart from the moment I met her. This girl is fierce and doesnt take no for an answer. Dangerous Possible chance of death Lilah is up for it She also pulls off to make people believe she is a guy and her ambition is to save money to buy a ship so she can becomes a pirate.  The plot was great fastpaced and makes sure you get to see every London. Kell has become a pawn in a bigger plot to destroy the world and to change everything. The villains are the perfect examples of characters you lovetohate. They are sadistic and crazy completely obsessed with power and magic.  Give me more please;V.E. Schwab

A guy can sleep around with girls and it is okay but a girl is a whore if she does the same. We dont get paid the same amount we can never talk about periods because it is almost something we must be ashamed about and we have to deal with the fact that society has this ideal picture we have to achieve.  Using words the wrong way can take away their meaning. Using words as mental and OCD can be really harmful for people who deal with this on a daily base.

So Parasite starts with some sleepwalker problems and in the conclusion we find out that it is because tapeworms are eating their way towards the brain.

Aspen Quick can steal anything from someone by touching them or an object that belonged to them. He can take away your memories your fears your passions just one moment of concentration and its gone. He uses this giftcurse to feed the Cliffs his ability keeps them from collapsing on the village. He works together with his grandmother Willow (able to feel when the Cliffs need magic) and aunt Holly (to guide whatever Aspen has stolen to the Cliffs). I thought it was a really interesting concept and I liked the process but in the end the author could have used it to make a more twisty tale.  Aspen has been left by his mother and she keeps looking for contact but he is too hurt by her. Slowly we figure out why his mother went away and how his dad influenced his life. This revelation was supposed to make Aspen more sympathetic but I simply cant overlook all the bad things he has done. He was so careless in his use of the gift  and everything had to be about HIM. He never left the douchebag stage from the beginning behind and that made this a hard book to read. I need to feel something more for a character and all Aspen did was getting on my nerves.  At the same time the writingstyle reads incredibly fast and I ended up reading this book in one sitting. I just think some parts could have been explored better especially when it comes to Leah a girl I did like. She stands up to Aspen and makes him realize in some rare moments that he is manipulating everyone around him without taking care of their feelings. Taking something from someone without care changing their personality without consent its awful.  Not too bad not mindblowing either.    The beginning is just horrible because the main character is one big douche. He is SO full of himself and doesnt think about the consequences of his actions. He sortof develops near the end of the book but it wasnt enough to redeem himself in my eyes.  Leah was by far the highlight of this book. She is a feminist and not afraid to tell Aspen the truth. I also liked her vulnerability but Im still confused about why Aspen couldnt do his creepy magic stuff on her  Full review to come.;Lindsay Ribar

I have a lot of thoughts so I will setting for this rating right now. I liked it. I really do but there were also many things I didnt like Its one of those confusing books where I loooooved it and on the other hand didnt because I see all the flaws. I flew through it it was entertaining the battle was epic but a lot of potential went to waste.  Spoiler review  The dislikes   The ending. I feel like there wasnt enough closure The whole ElainLucianMorAzriel thing The mortal Queens They are still out there probably waiting with their army but we will never get to see what is going to happen  Im not surprised that no one died in the end because I had a feeling she was going to skip that part. Im happy that they are all alive dont get me wrong but at the same time I feel like it would have added that extra piece of emotion to the story. Or what about Cassian losing those wings forever instead of magically healing and growing them back I just feel like a lot of potential was left there.. Also forever hate that dyingbutgettingbacktolifetrope and it happens TWICE.   The overly perfect characters and all the sappy scenes. Look I love them all but the whole deal where they feel they are the only one who want to protect the world.. The fact that they all want to sacrifice themselves as THE Savior. All those you will bow for no one you can make your own choices yadieyadieya situations. It got on my nerves. Also can we please stop those random headconversations between Rhys and Feyre It is rude to do so in public when you can simply use your mouth. Also not every conversation has to be flirtysexual. They dont all have to contain feasting on you and have the need to feel you in me   Still hate what she did with Tamlins character. He is turned into such a big villain and its ridiculous how Feyre ruins his court from the inside out destroying an army that could have been beneficial in the end battle. Like.. how did you think this was a good idea to punish someone who in the end was broken and loved her TOO much for their own good His love was definitely poisonous but it just feels so over the top.   All. Those. Sex. Scenes. She should have called it A Court of Sex and Purring because holy shit there was a lot of them. This book could be cut in half if you leave those scenes out and most of them made me cringe. I get it you are hungry beasts and all you can think about is ravishing each other all the time but you dont have to repeat it over and over again.   WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE MATES. WE KNOW IT. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.  What the fuck was her father doing on that ship suddenly acting like a hero  The likes   NESTA.   NESTA.   NESTA.   I liked that we got to see some of the other High Fae Lords.   The end battle was pretty good. It was brutal and big. Many different parties come looking around and it was definitely intense. I liked that Elain was the one to deliver the first strike on the King. I didnt see it coming.   The Bone Carver The Weaver and that thing at the bottom of the library with a name I always forget they were great additions to the story. Also forever sad about the Suriel because he was such an interesting character.   Did I mention NESTA   The writingstyle is so fast and entertaining. There are many parts that doesnt add something special and the editing could have used some finetuning but I always fly through her books. It was again one of those stories I couldnt lay down. Sue me. I liked it.;Sarah J. Maas

What a refreshing story This book is extraordinary despite its ordinary nature. This book isnt about the people with special hidden talents. This is a story about you and me the ones on the background while the Hero saves the day.  This book features a cast of several people but Mickey is the protagonist. He suffers from a severe form of OCD where he has to count and touch things until it feels good. He has a sister Mel who recently battled anorexia a best (gay) friend Jared and there is Henna the (African) girl he secretly fancies. As you can see they are a diverse bunch of ordinary people who have to conquer their own problems in life. That means it is up to the Indie kids to save the day when Aliens try to find new Vessels. These Indie kids get their own part in the story because every chapter starts with a short summary of what happened with them. I love how this was interwoven with Mickeys story.  The city is unaware of the supernatural situations. The adults are aware of strange occurrences but they seem to be blind for what is truly going on. Last time there was an attack by vampires this time the Chosen ones have to defeat Aliens. That is not Mickeys problem though. He is busy with graduation and the future. Will he still be best friends with Jared Will he finally be brave enough to talk to Henna about his feelings for her Is he able to keep is two sisters save  It was not hard to connect to Mickey and his ordinary life and issues. It was great to finally read a book about someone normal. He is not gifted or special in any way. He makes mistakes and he worries about the same ordinary things as any other teenager. I also love how Patrick Ness included a gay character without making a lot of fuss about it. It doesnt define Jared as a character its just part of who he is. Also the fact that Mickey hooked up at one point with Jared because of curiosity was something I appreciated.  I already found out that Patrick Ness has a wonderful writingstyle when I read More than this but this book was so much better to me. It has a solid ending and its a more straightforward story    Between 4.5 and 5 stars. That was brilliant.  Do we get to be the heroes and heroines of our own lives Maybe with small Hs Arent the things we do kind of extraordinary too Isnt loving our friends and making your own decisions kind of amazing I think so.

Edit Spoilers if you havent read any of the books No spoilers if you havent read this one yet.  1. I was SO disappointed at the beginning. I seriously wondered if I was falling out of love with the series. The writing was great as always but I felt disconnected. I also blame this on the ridiculous hype that has been spreading around like wildfire.  2. I love character development but not every change in Aelin worked for me. She is too harsh on Chaol and Dorian. She got on my nerves and really annoyed me at times. Doesnt take away that she is clever brave and strong. I still admire her. She gave up on Dorian without any problems. Oh I will just kill him and get it over with. Like he never meant anything for her at all.. and she needs to get over her issues with Chaol and stop being so awful judgmental. Damn girl. I dont get all the Chaol hate and I dont care what you think about him she was unfair. I already saw this coming because my beloved AelinChaol ship was sinking  what am I saying crashing  in Heir of fire and I already had a feeling it wasnt going to return. And you know what after the way she treats Chaol Im happy it is over. He deserves someone who is better for him and I quite like Nesryn. I also start to realize that Rowan is indeed a better match for Aelin. Chaol is too sweet.  3. The twists were superb. HOLY CRAP YOU GUYS. The King wasnt evil after all Woooow. And MY PRECIOUS CHAOL. His story line is hopefully going to play a bigger part in the next book with interesting developments.  4. Some badass fighting scenes.  5. MANON. You are the Queen. I looooooved her chapters. She was definitely the highlight in this book.  6. Rowan and Aedion need to stop fussing around her. Aelin survived the mines she is a master assassin she has freaking power that could easily destroy everyone and they are cuddling her. She is your Queen so NO she doesnt have to tell everything she does to you and NO she doesnt need to listen to you all the time. Stop treating her like a baby. Doesnt take away that she is sometimes too rash and explosive but she has balls and doesnt need two fathers around her.  7. After around 250 pages I fell back into love with the story and the ending was fantastic.  Brings me to a total of 4 stars. I had more issues with this book than I wanted but its still amazing and a worthy sequel in one of my favorite fantasy series so far.    THE TITLE.;Sarah J. Maas

There was something missing.  Bridey lives on an island close to England and she hates the ocean. She lost her grandfather after he dived into the water and drowned smiling while it happened. These memories return when dead girls are turning up in the summer and Bridey starts to suspect there is something mysterious that compels people to jump into sea. No one else seems to share her suspicions about the sea not even after more villagers start to vanish in the night.  I liked how the ocean is turned into something dark and frightening in this story. It was a pressing aspect. I also loved Bridey and how confident she is that the ocean is doing something to the people. She does not care that no one except for the islands witch and the boy she saves from a grim fate believes her. She just KNOWS it deep down and she will do anything to prove she is right.  The tale behind the boy she saves was interesting and I liked how it changed their dynamic. Their relationship was not my favorite one in this series (I liked Bridey  witch and Bridey  family more) but it was not bad either. I think the author gave it enough time to make it believable.  I think the ending was fitting for the overall feeling of the book.;Sarah Glenn Marsh

Hello new autobuy author. This book will definitely be in my top 10 favorite books of 2015.  4.5 stars.  This title is perfect for this book. There is indeed a discreet madness that seeps through the pages. This is a very subtle yet powerful story that will keep you up all night.  Grace is locked away in an asylum to protect her secret. She keeps her sharp mind hidden behind silence because Grace has one mission never return to her family even if that means she has to act like a mental patient. There is one person who sees her potential and he helps her escape to another asylum where Grace makes friends and has hope of a new life.  I love Grace. This girl had to deal with a horrifying situation but she is still capable of staying strong. This book is all about her mental strength and I adored her voice. She never let the horrifying things that happened to her break her. Instead she finds a way to build up a new life where she can use her impressive mind. Her clever observations are of use to her friend Thornhollow. He is a doctor with unique methods and he likes to help the police with murder cases. Those cases were unexpected and I liked the mystery. The relationship between Thornhollow and Grace was interesting.  The setting is fantastic. The first asylum is brutal and has the practices we often hear about. The girls are mentally and sometimes physically abused. The second ethical asylum is much better and Grace starts to develop a friendship with two girls. They both stole my heart. Lizzie has a best invisible friend called String who keeps her up to date about gossips and Nell has other issues that keep her off the streets. They are blunt and they have a whatyouseeiswhatyouget attitude that I admired.  There is no romance in this book and that is a good decision. The main character is not ready for it and there is enough story to keep you hooked from the beginning. Combine this with a killer writingstyle and you find yourself lost until you read the last page;Mindy McGinnis

Oh my You are probably aware of my undying love for Beauty and the Beast so Im happy to say this is a worthy retelling. I LOVED every single moment and I already cant wait to buy a hard copy so I can reread it.  Yevas father loses all his money after a stupid gamble for even more money and power. Yeva and her two sisters have to move into his tiny house in the forest away from town. Yeva is secretly relieved to live in a more quiet place but her fathers fraying mind is starting to worry her. One day he returns claiming he has to hunt down a monster and Yeva decides to go after him. Yeva is captured by the Beast but over time the two grow closer and she is torn apart by her feelings for him and her loyalty towards her family.  Yeva was fabulous and it didnt take me much time to fall in love with her personality and voice. I loved everything about her. She is (physically and mentally) strong wild and stubborn but never too rash in her decisions. She is so out of place in town but I like her attempts to fit in to make her father happy. It was clear from the beginning that she was meant for a different life than what he envisioned but I admired her loyalty to her family to try it anyway. Her restlessness and need for more is how she ends up in the hands of Beast.  Every once in a while you get to see his point of view at the beginning of a chapter and it is clear he has a troubled mind. I liked the jumpy and chaotic writing because it truly set him apart from the other characters in the book. His background story was fascinating and I was curious to see what the authors was planning to do with his curse awesome twist It felt like a fairytale inside a fairytale  and that background story made him a fascinating character.  The plot and writing moved with a fast yet steady pace. It was the perfect balance between giving things enough time and moving on so it wouldnt get too boring. The romance had enough time to blossom and I felt it happened subtle and believable. The writing is smooth absolutely fairytale worthy and filled with details without getting overwhelming. This book definitely shows instead of tells which made it easy to get swept away.  Definitely highly recommended.    4.55 stars.  Beauty and the Beast retellings are always scary for me since it is my favorite tale but THIS WAS SO GOOD. I LOVED IT.  Review to come.  _  YEEEEES. Keep them coming.  Beauty and the beast.

I fell head over heels in love with Say what you will. I was ready to be blown away by this book but that didnt happen. There was something about this book that prevented me from completely loving it. I had the same problem with the recent Just my luck.  Belinda lives together with her mother and grandmother. Her mother is depressive and Belinda has development disabilities. One day she is attacked and two people see it happen Emily and football player Lucas. Both of them decide to do nothing. This story is about the effect of this event and their choices on all three of them.  The story switches POV between Belinda Emily and Lucas. I think my main problem was the fact I didnt feel connected with them. Belinda had a distance in her voice which was understandable but that made it hard to feel anything for her. It was sad that she had to endure the attack and its terrible her disabilities prevent her from completely understanding what happened. This resulted in chapters  about her obsession with Pride  Prejudice her love for the theatre and her growing friendship with another disabled boy instead of an emotional process.  The realization of what happened and the aftermath of the assault was much bigger on Emily and Lucas who have to deal with their guilt. They are both signed up for community service with challenged teenagers. I liked their development throughout the story and how they deal with their wrong decision. Its obvious they are both shocked by their reaction in the situation. Despite that I didnt care much about Emily or Lucas. They never spoke to me and I already cant think of one thing that makes them stand out to me.  I think its a good plot that made me think. How would I react in a situation like that Its hard to say because I completely understand why both Emily and Lucas turned their head away. I think many people quickly decided someone else is probably going to take care of it. I think I would not immediately do something about it but I would call someone like the police  or in this case one of the teachers. The disconnection from the characters made this book less impressive than Say what you will though.;Cammie McGovern

I was excited when I started it. The beginning was interesting and set the worldbuilding Lunas parents King and Queen of Relhok were murdered by the evil chancellor the day of the eclipse. The world has been cloaked in darkness for 17 hours now. Only one hour midlight is save from the creatures that roam the world Dwellers. Fowler is on the run from his family and is saved by Luna. He is ordered to take her with him to a place that is rumored to be free of Dwellers.  Luna had her moments. She is blind but gifted with these some kind of superpowers that gave her unbelievable abilities. The author took it a little too far for my taste and I would have liked it more if she had toned it down. Luna is rash and she went back and forth between clever and downright stupid. Fowler gave me mixed feelings. He was too emotionless and harsh for my taste I would have liked to see his softer sight earlier in the story. His unpredictable twist was quite obvious from the beginning and might me sigh at how cliche it was. I was disappointed but I think Im willing to give the sequel a second chance.    I am conflicted about this book. For now I will give it 3 stars but Im not sure yet.  Quick thoughts  I like the darker setting.  Brutal ending.  Luna had potential but every time I thought she was going to be IT she did something stupid.  Fowler was okay.  Romance was sort of cute but way to fast and sappy.  Writing was extremely detailed and hard to connect with but at the same time I did finish this book in one day.;Sophie Jordan

The beginning wasnt mindblowing. The writingstyle is very simple and it felt a bit repetitive. The main character Livy recently lost her little sister Jenna. We see how she deals with this and how she tries to save the life of another sick girl. It felt like a circle until the retelling parts kicks in.  She meets Meyer who starts to change the way she looks at life. He challenges her and she is swept away into his world. It went a bit fast but I can understand her need to be with someone. Her parents have changed and Meyer helps to take her mind off the whole situation.  I like how the author sticks close to the true meaning of Peter Pan and how she combines the fantasy with our modern real world. The ending is good so overall not a bad retelling.;Shari Arnold

Ever the Hunted is a story with potential that let me down because it didnt manage to be something special. There are many cliches that dont have to be problems but I couldnt overlook them in this book. The writing itself was good and the reason I decided to finish this book instead of DNFing it. Its fast and easy but the true problem is the plot.  There is nothing wrong with a basic plot it only starts to form a problem when the author truly keeps it basic. The story fails to deliver something more. The characters are only soso the plot is predictable and the pacing is on the slow side. It all felt flat and uninspired to me.  Brittas father the official Bounty Hunter of the King has been murdered and her best childhood friend is the suspect. When Britta is caught poaching she has two choices die or join the hunt for Cohen. If she finds him she will get her freedom back. On her way Britta discovers clues that make her aware Cohen is around and eventually they meet and run away together. Cohen vows he didnt kill her father and it is up to them to discover the truth.  Britta and Cohen are both unmemorable characters. In the beginning I imagined her to be a little like Meria from Brave but that really isnt the case. She is great at tracking and she knows her way with the bow. Her father has taught her many things but most of the times she seemed clueless. There was nothing special about her and she had a slight damsel in distress syndrome. She faints and cries a lot. While I dont object to anyone displaying these emotions (because no crying doesnt make you look weak) Britta doesnt seem to be able to pick herself up without having a guy around. She is always secondguessing herself and needs a lot of affirmations from the people around her.  Cohen also lacks traits that make him stand out. He is the typical boynextdoor so I didnt give a crap about their plain romance. I always like the friendswhoturnintolovertrope (although I prefer sarcastichatetolove romance) but not if both characters bore me to death. There was also too much emphasis on their growing feelings.  The ending sort of made up for it but the overall story wasnt enough to make me want to pick up the sequel.

Dennaleia has been betrothed to prince of Mynaria Thandilimon ever since childhood. Her marriage will seal an alliance they need as protection from hostile lands like Zumordan. The only thing that will make this marriage a little hard is the fact Denna has an Affinity for Fire  and she is going to be queen of a kingdom where magic is forbidden. Oh and not to forget the fact she falls in love with Thandis sister Amaranthine called Mare.  1. This book probably has the most ridiculous names Ive ever seen. They are so freaking long I kept using the short versions (Denna Mara and Thandi) because good luck with their true names.  2. Thandi is the crown prince future king and husband of Denna but I feel like he hardly had any role in the story. He sometimes pops up to say a few words before he disappears again. The story definitely focuses more on Denna and Mare. I get it because the two of them fall in love so they need more time together but I dont think this was the right choice.  3. BUT I definitely love the fact that two princesses fall in love with each other. And since the author decided to give Thandi hardly any role so there is no lovetriangle. (Although we must not forget that Denna is practically cheating on Thandi since they are officially betrothed) Denna doesnt even seem to give him a chance and spends all her time with Mare. They were sweet together but also incredibly stupid. Lets just say that they are not the best in keeping their feelingssortofrelationship a secret from the outside world.  4. I think the author was trying to make Mare look like this rebellious kickass girl but instead she came across as childish and unnecessarily rude. I cant believe that someone who is 18 would ever act in such a way especially a princess. I also dont believe for one second that the king wouldnt have given her away in marriage already. Denna is also practically betrothed from the moment she was born so why would Mare be any special Until the moment where the two of them say they love each other then suddenly the king decided he wants to ship Mare off. What a coincidence Lets throw this in for some more drama.  5. Oh right not to forget that there is also something going on to give the love story some plot. There are several assassin attempts and one of them kill possibly the only character I absolutely loved and MareDenna team up to find out who is behind it. For some reason the king and his council decide that it has to be the Zumordan without any prove and they will not listen to reason. Very mature.  6. And not to forget there is some magic. Denna is struggling with her powers because her mother always forced her to keep it a secret. This leads to random outbursts and the discovery she doesnt only control fire. I liked this aspect.    I love the fact that the Princess falls in love with the other Princess instead of Prince but the plot dragged a little. Also the names were so ridiculous..  Review to come.;Audrey Coulthurst

The best part is that the inside matches the outside because this was a highly enjoyable story.  Ravenous is set in the same world and time as Monstrous but is not much of a sequel. There are a few shoutouts to Kymera and Ren the protagonist and secondary character from Monstrous but in principle this book could be read as a standalone. I would recommend to read the both of them though because they are both surprising in their own way.  Greta is one of the kidnapped girls who were kept as food in Belladoma. She returned home but all that is left of her family is her little brother Hans. Greta desperately wants to find out what happened to their parents and why they suddenly left but she knows she must take care of Hans now. The two manage to survive until Hans is taken by a hungry witch. Greta makes a deal she must bring an old treasure that belonged to the deceased king of Belladoma and in return she can have Hans back. This is the start of a big adventure because things does not come easy to Greta. She is not the only one hunting down this item and some are willing to go far to get it in their hands.  I loved Greta and her protectiveness over Hans. She was a clever brave girl who is willing to sacrifice anything to keep her brother save. Their relationship was definitely a fun addiction to the story. What I also admired about this book is that the author never makes it feel or sound too childish but at the same time Greta does not feel too old for her age. This results in a book that is great for any age. The author also does not shy away from giving emotional punches something I also noticed in Monstrous.  The only thing is that the plot could have moved a little bit faster at times but it also gave time for development. Greta meets a halfboyhalfanimal from a village made out of different animalpeople and I liked how their friendship develops. In the beginning they are forced to be together but slowly they start to appreciate each other. I liked their mutual respect.  Definitely a good spin on Hansel and Gretel;MarcyKate Connolly

There she begins a journey causing her to question everything she believes about life death memories and reincarnation.In 1925 Alice Lind steps off a train in the rainsoaked coastal hamlet of Gordon Bay Oregon. There she expects to do nothing more difficult than administer IQ tests to a group of rural schoolchildren. A trained psychologist Alice believes mysteries of the mind can be unlocked scientifically but now her views are about to be challenged by one curious child.Sevenyearold Janie ODaire is a mathematical genius which is surprising. But what is disturbing are the stories she tells that her name was once Violet she grew up in Kansas decades earlier and she drowned at age nineteen. Alice delves into these stories at first believing theyre no more than the product of the girls vast imagination. But slowly Alice comes to the realization that Janie might indeed be telling a strange truth.Alice knows the investigation may endanger her already shaky professional reputation and as a woman in a field dominated by men she has no room for mistakes. But she is unprepared for the ways it will illuminate terrifying mysteries within her own past and in the process irrevocably change her life.;384;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1457009942m25566506.jpg;Yesternight;history historical fiction biography;2.5 stars.  This book is way slower than her previous books. The ending was like a punch in my face I did not see it coming and it left me with an unsatisfied feeling.. I also felt a distanced from the characters although I did appreciate Alice and her sister Bea. The whole concept was fascinating but the overall story didnt do it for me.  Not her best work )    Alice Lindt is still troubled by her past where she had nightmares and fits of violence. No one in her family likes to talk about what truly happened which is one of the reasons she pushed on to become a psychologist. Alice had a hard time in college because of the sneers from her male students and her hunger for sex.  She is now traveling around taking tests from children to see if they need special attention or a different approach in their education. This brings her to the case of young Janie and her father Michael. He believes Janie has a reincarnation inside her from a 19 year old girl Violet Summers who died years ago after drowning in a lake. The more Alice gets to know about this Violet girl the more she starts to believe in the fact that reincarnation might be a thing  and it could destroy her entire career. This opens also the opportunity to explore her own past.  The difficulty I had was the fact I felt distanced from Alice and the secondary characters. I liked that she continued to work on this case and that she choose this career despite being a woman in this time period. I also loved the loose part in her character because woman werent allowed to enjoy sex especially not with different men. BUT I could not connect with her at all and that made the slower parts of this story even harder to bear.  At the end of the book I had no closure. Janies reincarnation is brushed away when her mother swept her away leaving Michael brokenhearted. This set the chemistry between him and Alice in motion which ended in a punch in the face. I clearly did not see it coming and it could have worked if the ending of the book had a conclusion. I feel like we are left with a few more questions and it bugs me that I will never know what is going to happen with the possible reincarnation of Michael into her sons body. And is Alice truly just a big.. crazy or did she really have a reincarnation of a murderer in her Did I miss something;Cat Winters

This book is probably a it is me not you situation but I was BORED to tears.  The setting was something I liked. It is an alternate Victorian world where everything is controlled by the clock towers. If something happens to it it can fracture time and mess up people lives. If it is destroyed the entire town stops existing and no one can leave or enter. This happened to Danny Harts father who has been trapped for three years now. Danny is a seventeenyearold mechanic. He can repair clocks and sense the fabric of time.  The only thing is that I am conflicted about the whole Godsmythology like explanations behind the clock towers. It just did not work for me and seemed out of place. At the same time I understand the need to explain the function of the clock towers and how it works..  Back to Danny who is assigned to Enfield where the tower seems to be plagued by problems. Danny works together with his new apprentice who later on happens to be more than he appears. The two of them start to fall in love which is an absolutely nogo. And this is where things went downhill for me. Danny and his special snowflake did nothing for me. Their feelings develop WAY too fast and ugh it felt too forced for my taste. I like the fact that the main character is gay and that felt all very natural but their love came out of nowhere and seemed to be based on chemistry alone.  Combine it with a plot that moves in the sloooooooowest pace ever and Im done. I did finish this book because I still wanted to see if I was right about the person behind the bombings (I was) but I will not continue this series.    Look at me being the official first black sheep among my friends.  It was so slow and boring. The romance has zero buildup (although it was definitely cute) and the plot just drags on.

Two years ago I fell in love with Prisoner of night and fog. Last year Blankman lived up to my expectations with Conspiracy of blood and smoke. This year she proves she is a solid author with Traitor Angels and I can already tell you I wil read whatever she is going to write next. If I would have to compare this book with anything else I would say it has the same vibes as The Da Vinci Code. With clues and hidden messages that takes Elizabeth on a journey that may destroy society as they know it.  One thing Blankman excels at is writing fleshedout characters mainly females that prove you can be strong without having muscles. Elizabeth is the daughter of famous poet John Milton and she helps him with his latest work after he lost his sight. He also makes sure she is able to handle a sword and Elizabeth has a feeling he is training her for something more but she has no idea what until the night comes where John is arrested by the kings man. Elizabeth has to follow a message he encoded in his halffinished Paradise lost and together with Antonio an Intalian scientist she has to crack the secret.  Elizabeth is smart brave and easy to connect with. I fell in love with her voice right after the start and she did not disappoint me. She has a different way of thinking than is expected of females and I liked how her father gave her space to explore things she likes. It is obvious he gave her a broad education while growing up. That is also something that made me appreciate Antonio and their growing feelings. He completely supports Elizabeth and her passion for science something that is out of the question for her gender. He respects her and her thoughts and they had such an equal understanding you cant help yourself from falling in love with him too. The best part about the romance besides being slowbuilding was the fact it never takes the front seat. This book is all about figuring out what her father has hidden in his poem.  During all twists turns and clues it is obvious that the author did her research. There are many topics she explores that makes sure you are hooked to the story and I have learned a few new things as well. The historical setting is really nicely done. There is an emphasis on religion and Galileo Galileis work  and it is all blended so well into the story. I think it will also appeal to people to tend to stay away from historical reads because there is so much else to explore as well.    3.54 stars. Really wellresearched historical story with a journey filled with puzzles that reminded me a little of The Da Vinci code.  Review to come.;Anne Blankman

When her grandmother gets really sick Red decides to go away to find a cure. On her way she comes across two new friends a wolf and Goldie who wants to find a love potion for her parents.  I really liked how Shurtliff blended different tales into one story and how she switched up the roles of certain characters. It made is creative and fun to explore. There are even some nods to Rump who was Reds best friend before her moved away. Red herself reminded me of Jack and how they are both brave enough to go on a journey all by themselves.  The best part however was the growing friendship between Red and Goldie. Red has turned into a bit of a lonely introvert girl. Everyone in the village is afraid of her and try to avoid her. This has made Red so independent that she first tries to turn Goldie away. Throughout the book we see how Red develops and changes around Goldie the two become close and start to depend on each other.  The plot itself is interesting enough to keep you occupied. Red catches a dwarf and uses his knowledge to hunt down three cures for her grandmothers sickness but they all come with a price. There is an important message in this book that Red starts to realize sometimes the inevitable thing happens and you cant stop it. This makes this book heavier than the previous ones but it handles it in such a way it is not too dark for children.  Overall fun story with an unique spin on Red Riding Hood and Goldilocks.    That was really cute and creative. I liked the way the author blended Red Riding Hood with Goldielocks (and we even get to see a few other characters popping up from other fairytales)  Review to come.;Liesl Shurtliff

There are problematic things in this book.  I still dislike how Tamlin is suddenly the biggest asshole and Rhys is this perfect hot understanding guy. I really like Rhys dont get me wrong but the contrast is SO big and unnecessary.  Feyre was still annoying as fuck when she repeatedly kept reminding us how broken she was how broken Tamlin was how broken their relationship was I GET IT.  And for some reason I was also aware how many times people said things in a purring way and it was really distracting me.  BUT I cant help myself from loving it. The writingstyle the plot itself the action towards the ending it is simply so entertaining. It is fabulous in all its ridiculousness.    First of all I really liked it BUT there were definitely quite some points that bothered me. I have to agree with some of the points Jeann made here  httpswww.goodreads.comreviewshow...  Spoilers for this book.    1. Tamlin is suddenly THE biggest villain in the world together with Lucien and his Spring Court. To make me like another male loveinterest in the book you dont have to make me hate another... Ive seen this happen in Throne of glass where she shed a bad light on Chaol. Tamlin is even worse and I actually fell sorry for him and his portrayal. She took everything he was from the first book stripped it and filled it with hate and obsessive love. He cant do anything right all his actions are completely irrational and he is turned into this big boogey man. Shame.  2. Rhys on the other hand is the most flawless perfect fairy ever. While I really liked him we should not forget how he acted in ACOTAR. Sure all his behavior is swept away with explanations in this book but we need to keep in mind that he is also to blame for many mistakes. It was good to see another side of him and I appreciate many of the things he did but I dont like how he looked like a God now.  3. I could not get over the fact how many times Feyre tells us that she is broken. That Tamlin is broken. That their relationship is broken. I GET IT OKAY. And of course she is now powerful and exceptional and special. I actually think I would have loved this story more if she would be more like her sister Nesta who is a feisty girl who is willing to fight until her last breath for what she stands for. I think we will see more of her in the next book.  That was a lot of sexy times for a YA. Which is great because lets be real things like this happen (although I dare to say that not a lot of people have sex multiple times for an entire night) but this should definitely be targeted as a NA.  I LOVED the plot and the ending was fantastic. It was a book I could not put down and it makes me crave the sequel ) I just wished some things would have been a bit different.;Sarah J. Maas

Then there is August Flynn whose father is more softhearted. In fact August is one of those feared monsters but he desperately wants to be a human. Together with his brother and sister they are his fathers secret weapon. So when August sees Kate he jumps on the opportunity and the two of them need to work together to survive.  The writing is by far my favorite aspect of this book and it is something I expect from Schwab at this point. She knows how to write and how to use her words in the most effective way. I liked Kate and August but I did not fall in love with them as easily as Kell and Lila from A Darker Shade of Magic. I think in the end I prefer August because he has this super special monster trick he has to use to survive  and it made him such an interesting and complex person.  I look forward to more.    Really good but not my favorite from Schwab (lets be honest nothing can beat the brilliance of A darker shade of magic)  Review to come );Victoria Schwab

I had a good experience with Tinteras previous Dystopian duology Reboot so I had high expectations for this series despite some negative reviews on my Goodreads feed. Let me tell you this I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. The 0.5 was taken off because the romance developed a little too fast for my taste but Em and Cas were fantastic together. They start with a bit of a hate relationship and thats my favorite thing.  Em is the princess of Ruina. The Ruined are being hunted and killed because people are afraid for their powers. At the same time the Ruined are not innocent. She is looking for her capture sister who is being held by the king who killed her parents. He happens to be the father from Prince Cas of Lera engaged to princess Mary  and Em is portraying to be that girl. Cas doesnt want to get married but he is surprised by MaryEm.  The plot is quite basic but the characters and how Tintera filled it with details made the story for me. Em was simply fabulous. This girl is ruthless clever and strong. She made me laugh a couple of times when she daydreams about ways to kill everyone in a room. Very resourceful. Cas was the typical good guy. He is openminded and kind nothing like his father. Tintera has a fantastic writingstyle that easily sucks you into the story and I LOVED that horrible ending. It makes me want to pick up the sequel right away.    0.5 star for the romance that developed a bit too quickly for my taste but they had enough chemistry to make me buy it.  I simply fell in love with it. The plot is pretty basic and on itself nothing special but I adore the writingstyle and I really liked Em. She was more brutal than I was expecting like thinking about how she could murder everyone in a room. She also killed for her cause and I thought it was refreshing how she reacted in certain situations. Sometimes the MCs are a bit too rash and throw themselves in situations that make things only worse. Em was capable of keeping her head cool and I really appreciated that.

I think we all know by now that Im not a contemporary reader. There are a few books that Ive tried in the past that worked for me and this is now officially one of them. I heard a lot of good things about Girl Against the Universe on Twitter so I decided to get a copy from Edelweiss to give it a shot  and I am so happy I did This book was the perfect mix between fluffy and emotional. It was never too heavy but at the same time did not shy away from the reality of both Maguires and Jordys problems. The author managed to strike a good balance between a tougher story and a blossoming romance that all starts with an unlikely friendship. The overall story was inspiring.  Maguire has had her share of bad luck and she writes it all down in her notebook to prove she is cursed. One of the worst things that happened to her was surviving a car crash while her father brother and uncle died. Maguire is now afraid to cause harm to others so she stays away from friendship and situations where she is surrounded by people. Maguire is now in therapy and she wants to work to one important goal learning to overcome her fear and fly in a plane to her family abroad.  Jordy is an aspiring tennis star who is with the same therapist as Maguire. He has a hard time figuring out who he is and his parents push him in other directions than his heart. The two of them meet after one of Maguires sessions and when she has to join a sport she runs into him during a tennis tryout. The two of them start a special kind of friendship they both desperately need each other.  I loved how Maguire developed throughout the story. We see a girl who is afraid of anything grow into the person she was meant to be. The fact that she was brave enough to conquer her fears inspired me because sometimes I let fears hold me back. Making a check list to help her work towards her goal was such a good idea and I liked how Jordy helped her. His story showed that sometimes its good to talk with someone else even if your problem might not look that serious. He definitely showed a lot of improvement throughout the story but Maguire was the highlight to me.  I liked their relationship and how it slowly transitions. It felt realistic and friendstomore is one of my favorite things right after banter and sass. If you like contemporary books with a bit more depth this is the one for you.;Paula Stokes

This book was recommended to me by my bookclub before I went on my vacation to Italy  and it was definitely the perfect story for it. The plot was a bit farfetched (especially how Aubree was placed into this situation) but it was enjoyable and quick.  Aubrees sister knows what she wants in life and she works hard for it. When Aubrees party gets out of hand Elizabeth gets in trouble. This prevents her from going to her summer job and she needs it for her future work. Aubree takes over her job leading a group of senior citizens on a bus tour through Europe.  In the beginning Aubree has no idea what she is supposed to do but she slowly warms up and manages to save herself. It was not all too believable at times (like one of the passengers happens to be a history teacher and he takes over one of her tours) but I liked the tour around Europe. The romance also came a bit out of nowhere (from a phone call with a boy to suddenly kissing him in one of the cities) but he was cute and I liked their chemistry.

SPOILER FREE if you havent read the first two books either.  This series has a lot of ups and downs. The Queen of the Tearling blew me away. I was confused by the worldbuilding but I fell in love with Kelsea and the sidecharacters like the Mace. There was something about her actions and the way it moved the plot into interesting directions that got me hooked.  The Invasion of the Tearling was SO different and it took me a good amount of time to get into it. Kelsea showed an even darker side and I appreciated the fact she was so flawed. We got more information about the Red Queen who rules in Mortnesme and how she became that ruthless person. The only thing I did not like was the new storyline that was added because it really did not seem to fit the atmosphere of the first book. I always thought this story took place in a more Medieval setting and this new character made me realize that was not the case at all.  That storyline continues in The Fate of the Tearling and starts to play a bigger role. It shows the basics of the worldbuilding and how Kelseas world was created. The background information was interesting but at the same time I didnt care for the characters who played a role in it. I kept flipping the pages in the hope the story would switch back to Kelsea. It was an interesting (and in the end brave) decision to create such a plot though.  Kelsea has a long journey coming from the girl who grew up in the Woods into a Queen who is capable of handling tough situations. I still admired her and the way she deals with everything that got in her way. I dont think she always made the best decisions but she always made them with her country in mind and that loyalty is admirable.  The ending was something I did not expect and took me off guard  and Im still not entirely sure how I feel about it. It matches the new approach the story took in the Invasion of the Tearling but at the same time it did not give me enough satisfaction. This is probably one of those endings you can never completely hate or dislike it just messes with your thoughts.  I liked the overall series but I have to say that the sequels did let me down after The Queen of the Tearling. This might because of my different expectations or the fact I did not like the worldbuilding in the end. Im definitely going to keep an eye on the movie and any further books from this author because she does know how to write.  These people are so damned proud of their hatred Hatred is easy and lazy to boot. Its love that demands effort love that exacts a price from each of us. Love costs this is its value.    I finished this book yesterday and Im still not sure how I feel about it. The ending was so risky and a brave move but at the same time it doesnt satisfy me enough.. I will rate this book at a later time when Ive had more time to think about it.  Review  rating to come.;Erika Johansen

A crew of six people need to break into a highly secured building to release a prisoner that holds the information to a product that could change the world they know. Kaz is the leader and is always looking for a way to earn money. He cant refuse this offer but he needs his crew to pull it off.  This group of people quickly turned into my favorite characters of all time. I have lost my heart to Heartrender Nina and spy Inej. I have fallen in love with all the touches of romances (also between two guys) and how each and everyone of them has their own voice. Leigh has managed to craft a cast of characters that all provide something unique to the story and I was never overwhelmed by all the different voices. She gives everyone their chance to shine and we get to learn their story throughout the book it really gave them a lot of dimension and character development. Plus she knows how to write some kickass girls. I would love to be as powerful as Nina  The heist was nervewracking and I liked the reason they were sent to break out the prisoner. I was constantly worried about how Kaz was going to do it. This guy is a mastermind and his clever ways blew me away.

Im still not completely sold on it but it is definitely not the worst relationship ever. Tarik an Sepora spend time together trying to come up with a solution for the possible upcoming war before they get feelings for each other. The whole speak of love developed a bit quickly but I could look past that. He is at least respectful towards her and cares for her opinion. Its a shame I never had strong shippy feelings.  1. I liked how the story started. The setting was a bit confusing (and I still dont really understand how Spectronium works) but it is a basic plot that always works. Sepora is from one Kingdom and her father is using her for his hunger for more power. She decides to flee to the enemy Kingdom to hide but instead is sold into Tariks harem. Now she finds herself struggling between defending her own people and saving Tariks people from her father.  2. Sepora (did not like this name) is a special snow flake. She immediately becomes the prettiest girl in the harem she is always praised for her intelligence she is capable of fighting (yet is capture in the first few chapters) and she is the only one left to Forge the Spectronium everyone is looking for. Nevertheless she has some spunk and I didnt hate her.  3. Tarik is forced to take the throne when he is only 18 years old (normally it passes down when the King dies on an old age) and he is not ready for it. Perhaps that is why he lets Sepora defy him in every way without punishing her. He finds her interesting and refreshing but most of the times I just found her rude. Also the whole switch from her career as possible mistress in his new harem to servant of his adviser was too farfetched for my taste.  Not the worst. Not the best.;Anna Banks

The setting of this book reminded me of Alice in Wonderland. It is strange quirky and all over the place I liked it.  Mafi has a very telling way and that made it especially in the beginning hard for me to get hooked to the story. It makes it slow but there are definitely a few beautiful lines that I had to reread. The many details made it colourful and different from any book Ive read so far but I did not fall in love with this particular writingstyle. It could not sweep me away.  Shed decided long ago that life was a long journey. She would be strong and she would be weak and both would be okay.  This book definitely had some good points. First the charming friendship between Alice and Oliver. They start on the wrong foot but the time they spend together in Furthermore creates a strong bond. I like how they both get over their initial disliking. I also liked Alice and the fact she smacks Oliver a couple of times in the beginning. She is a feisty girl who is lonely and sad after the disappearance of her father. The people in her village dont accept her because of her different looks and her mother cant cope with the loss and takes it out on her. I think Alice was brave and strong under her circumstances.  It was good but not as good as I hoped it would be.;Tahereh Mafi

Im always willing to improve things in my lifestyle so I got an ebook copy from Bol.com to see what the hype is all about.  I must say that Im not TOO impressed. I liked some of the things that were said and the whole idea of setting up one hour in the morning with things that help with personal development but I dont feel I really needed this book to help me realize such a thing. It is however a final push to give it a shot. I want to see if I can also turn from this pleaseletmesleepmorningcreature into someone who can wake up more easily. I did like the tip of writing down affirmations and making them specific for each goal.  The author kept repeating that 95 of the people are just living day by day without living their full potential and this book promises you will become part of that 5.. By only waking up one hour earlier I can see how it will motivate me to change certain aspects of my life but I dont think it will be SUCH a radical change  and overall Im already really happy with my life. Even if that means I might not be part of that 5 he so desperately want to reach.  The story itself felt a bit over the top and tried so hard to be positive that it became a little annoying. I didnt like the writingstyle because it felt more like reading a diary than a real selfhelp book. I was waiting for more concrete ideas to help me out but when it comes to helpful lists and specific ideas the author kept referring to his website.  Overall Im happy I gave it a shot and I definitely have gotten a few ideas but I dont find it as lifechanging and hypeworthy as I thought it would be.;Hal Elrod

That is a lot of sex. I dont mind it per se because it is a natural and beautiful thing but the entire plot and story moves aside to show us hot steamy screaming sex scenes. I GET IT ALREADY. Rowan walks around with a boner because he is such a horny puppy and Aelin acts like she can burst from tension any time of the day. It annoyed me.  2. Aelin is not Celaena and while I get that I sometimes long for the girl she used to be. It is a brave move to develop her character in this way but I dont think it is the right fit for me. Where I used to love her braze arrogant attitude it now makes me want to strangle her. Where I used to appreciate her strength it now makes too strong for her own good which means she lies and keeps things to herself and I dont like that.  3. There is no Chaol. I know there are two sides and you either LOVE him or HATE him but no matter how you feel about him he still deserves to be part of this story. You cant just write him out of this so you can give Aelin and Rowan some more scenes where they can stare at each other with longing. He simply fell away and yes I do LOVE HIM A LOT I am interested to see what is going to happen to him..  4. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WITH DORIAN He is suddenly this dark almost creepy seductive dude And no seriously no what the fuck is he doing with Manon She is supposed to be with her girlfriend  5. The writingstyle is still really addictive and easy.  6. The ending kicked ass. Seriously this was the part where I was waiting for the entire book. Maas shined again and showed me why I love this series despite the biggest flaws ever. If only there was more action and twists like this in the rest of the book..  7. ELIDE. What a girl definitely my favorite together with Manon.    After much deliberation Im going to settle with 3.5 stars. Review to come.    I need to think about the rating. Mixed feelings that go from LOVE to bummer this could have been so much better..  Review to come if I manage to write something coherent.;Sarah J. Maas

I feel like the story was stretched too much and would have benefited from being a standalone. The split POV characters didnt add anything special and was actually more distracting.  Aerity has decided to marry the person who killed the beast lord Leif Alvi like promised although her heart belongs to someone else. Ive never been a fan of the romance with her lover in the first place  thought it moved way too fast and unbelievable  but I do like the idea of someone giving up her heart for her Kingdom. Still terrible to ask such a thing for your daughter but lets be honest girls were married off to worse marriages in history. It is complicated when it is obvious that Leif has feelings for someone else too.  They have to fight against Lashed Rozaria Rocato and Pax has joined her but has to decide how far he is willing to go to play his role as spy. In the first book his opinion about her shifted completely and now he has to deal with the consequences of his decision.  The end was quite obvious and not surprising. The plot was thin. The writing okay. The many romances too much for my taste.    Satisfying ending but definitely not my favorite duology. I feel like the story could have been told in a standalone.

The thing about this book is that the blurb pretty much tells you the entire story. It only fails to deliver the message that this is written from the point of view of Runajo and Paris Catresou  two characters that both failed to make an impression on me.  The tale starts and has several flash backs at the moment where Romeo and The Juliet meet and decide to be together. The Juliet (because this is not her actual name but a title) is bound to her oath to kill her enemies but she decide to sneak her way out of it with Romeo so they can get married. Things all fall apart when Paris throws himself in the middle of the situation which ends up with The Juliet dead and him bound to Romeo.  Runajo is part of the Sisters who oversee the feeding of the magic around the city that protects them from zombielike people. She has the idea she could save the only city that is left in the world by diving into the Archive of the Library that is overflown by the Ruined (although Im not sure if thats what you call them. I must admit that I was pretty bored at that point) She does something stupid and she ends up saving The Juliet from dead which binds the girl to her.  Both storylines never meet at the end of the story which made it all feel pretty pointless and the switching distracted me. The author also threw in a Necromancer with an evil plan where The Juliet apparently needs to play a big role and there are also different terms like Mahyani. At some point I could not keep track of who belonged where and what every title meant.. This was definitely not helpful because I also couldnt care less about any of the characters. They were bland and especially Romeo got on my nerves. Runajo and The Juliet had the most potential but failed to fully deliver.  Shame shame shame because I still count Cruel Beauty from this author as one of my favorite books and I hoped I could add this story to that list. Now it will go on the DNFseries pile. The ending might have been interesting enough to make me want to pick up the sequel but based on how bored I was.. I dont think I will remember much of the story once it is published. 2 stars for the gorgeous cover the fact I did finish the book and the approach of the original tale.  Once upon a time she believed she was only a sword. Now she fears she is only a girl.    Cruel beauty is one of my favorite books but Bright Smoke Cold Fire story simply did not live up to that brilliance. [And yes that makes me a little sad]  1. There is a constant switch between perspectives which did not work in this case. Sometimes it can add something but it just prevented me from connecting with the story. The story is told by Paris and Runjaro who get accidentally with Romeo and Juliet.  I sometimes liked Runjaro and how ruthless she was but both she and Paris failed to have a distinct personality and interesting voice. Juliet had her kickass moments but overall she bored me and Romeo was just a big failure to me.  2. The plot hardly moves forward. At the end of the book I dont feel like weve gotten much further.  3. No ships for me. The Juliet  Romeo have already entered the stage of constant swooning especially because they both believe the other is dead.  The ending might make me want to pick up the sequel but based on how bored I was.. I dont think I will remember much of the story once it is published. 2 stars for the gorgeous cover the fact I did finish the book and the original approach of the original tale. This book features zombies and necromancers which was interesting.;Rosamund Hodge

I was fascinated by the promise of this book from the moment I read the blurb and it did not disappoint me. Kendare created a story that is not like any other Ive read this year and I am now highly anticipating the sequel.  Fennbirn is ruled by one Queen but getting that title is a dangerous game. Every generation a set of triplets is born and each baby possesses their own magic Elemental Poisoner and Naturalist. The night they turn sixteen the battle for the crown begins and the last one standing is the new Queen.  Three Dark Crowns tells the tale of Mirabella a strong and fierce Elemental who is rumored to the be one to finally push the line of Poisoner Queens of the throne. Katherine is a Poisoner but her magical abilities are shallow and there is a lot of pressure on her shoulders. Then there is Arisinoe a Naturalist who is not nearly as powerful as the rumors claim she is. It is clear that this round is not about the strongest but the darkestmost ruthless one to claim the throne.  The story is divided into chapters each switching between the three sisters. This could have been confusing but works well in this situation. It gives us the ability to see the situation through three different eyes how each of the possible Queens deal with their power and the upcoming battle. I liked all three of them but felt that Mirabella was the most distant voice. Her part of the story gripped me less than the struggle from both Katherine and Arsinoe.  Katherine has to deal with trials to make her body adjust to the presence of poison but it is a painful and slow process. Arsinoe is in a better situation with her powerful friend Jules who will do anything to keep her safe.  The writingstyle was good but some parts still dragged a little. The ending (while I was anticipating that turn of events) made me grin. The sequel promises to be interesting and I cant wait to see how it all wraps up. Are these three sisters going to change the way their country is ruled for years  or will one of them finish it all    I loved the bizarre concept and how all three Queens have their own identities. I especially liked Arsinoe who also seems to have the most pages and her best friend Jules. There was something about the writingstyle though that made me feel a little disconnected from the story and some parts dragged a little. And I loved the ending despite seeing it coming.  I liked it enough to get a hardcover and I will definitely pick up the sequel.  Review to come.;Kendare Blake

Unfortunately I was highly disappointed by this second and last book.  Luna is stubborn and most of the times this is a trait I love in characters but it is also dangerous and in this case it didnt work out. Luna kept strongly believing in what she thought was right that she hurt the people around her in the process. She definitely needed a good shake or a slap in the face (which obviously didnt happen..) to wake her up out of her stupidity.  Also I liked the idea of having a blind character but Luna is suddenly this girl with all these superpowers and it was just too much. I would have loved it if the author had taken a more realistic approach.  The romance.. Oh well. I quite like Fowler but the unnecessary drama was so over the top. Luna seems to forget that Fowler never choose his own father so her hatred for Fowler was childish. The fact the stayed so loyal to her is admirable because I would have probably stabbed her to death at some point (not really but you get the idea)  Disappointing..    yawn  review to come.;Sophie Jordan

In the beginning of the book there is an introduction from someone who says that the author also writes poems I was expecting a lot from her writingstyle but to be honest it felt a bit choppy to me. It wasnt clicking with me and that prevented me from getting sucked into the story.  I thought it was great that this book features a blind character without giving her these overthetop powers to make her badass. Isabelle simply rocked and the fact she cant see added something extra to her personality. Aurora was less interesting to me because she felt more distant. I couldnt connect with her but I did like her part in the story. The switch from POV between the two sisters was distracting though and it made the story slow. There could have been more exciting twists and turns although I did like all the original elements the author put in the story like the way the fairies take something before they bestow a gift on the princess and that we get to see Auroras dream while she is asleep.  Overall an okay book.;Lexa Hillyer

It is pretty clear this is a setup for the finale.  The plot is shallow. Dina is wandering around has to deal with some obstacles but has no clear destination. The juvenile tone of the book didnt bother me but I think it will be something other people might struggle with. I thought it made the book really fast to fly through so it made up for the slow pace of the story itself.  I also liked the believable relationship between Dina and Wardley. It added a great touch to the book and the author kept it realistic she took an approach you dont often see in books. Credits for that;Colleen Oakes

This book is part of the series but they have separate stories.  Alister Teague is cursed and he uses all his wit to break free. If you come across him and you make a deal with him it means you are screwed. Alister is a foul player and that is how he manages to use Thads desperation against him. He forces the boy into becoming King and in return Alister will keep Thads sister Ari save from their murderous family. Ari isnt happy with this change of life and together with Sebastian she tries to come up with a plan to get rid of Alister.  Ari is feisty and intelligent. She knows something is up with Thad and the mysterious Teague and shes not going to wait to see what is going to happen. Instead she is doing her own research and this leads her in the arms of Sebastian the new blacksmith with a story of his own. Piece by piece Ari finds out what has transpired between Thad and Teague and what this will mean in the future. Her plan to release Thad is dangerous and shows her loyalty for her family. I adored the fierce love between her and her brother. It was nice to finally have another book with a healthy brothersister relationship. It was my favorite aspect of the story.  Thad and Sebastian are both solid character. Neither of them are really memorable on their own but I liked their role in the plot. The blossoming romance between Sebastian and Ari was adorable. Its not one of those I SHIP THIS HARDCORE ship but I liked their chemistry and how supportive they were.  The plot is fastpaced and the writingstyle is so smooth and easy to read.

But thats before she realizes that Dax Miller is locked in with her. Autumn doesnt know much about Dax except that hes trouble. Between the rumors about the fight he was in (and that brief stint in juvie that followed it) and his reputation as a loner hes not exactly the ideal person to be stuck with. Still she just keeps reminding herself that it is only a matter of time before Jeff her almostboyfriend realizes he left her in the library and comes to rescue her.Only he doesnt come. No one does.Instead it becomes clear that Autumn is going to have to spend the next couple of days living off vendingmachine food and making conversation with a boy who clearly wants nothing to do with her.

Ive come to this point where I am sure I will never dislike a book written by Kasie West. This concept is probably my favorite one of her so far. I think every bookworm has a daydream where they are locked up in the library especially if this happens to be together with a cute boy.  Autumn is on her way to a fun weekend with her friends especially with her almostboyfriend Jeff when she gets stuck in the library. She keeps expecting someone to return and pick her up but her friends dont seem to realize Autumn is left behind. Then she finds out she is not alone Dax is there too and he has a good reason to be there. The two have a rocky start mainly because of their prejudices but slowly they start to talk and a friendship is formed.  I loved both Autumn and Dax. Autumn suffers from anxiety and has panic attacks  and now she cant take her medication. During the book we see her struggle with these problems and it was something I could identify with to a certain point. Dax has an entire different story that Ill not talk about in details but believe me when I say he doesnt have the most happy youth while growing up and it has given him a reputation at school. Both Dax and Autumn have prejudices against each other and it was nice to see them overcome this. Autumn and Dax start to open up to each other and it was heartwarming to see them form a special bond.  I think West did a good job at showing Autumns confusion because she starts to like Dax while she is almost in a relationship with Jeff. There is no touch of lovetriangle at all and this is the type of situation I could see happening in real life. She also struggles with his distant behavior because can they keep this friendship alive outside the library  Like always this is a fluffy book with a deeper touch to it and I flew through the pages. Keep them coming West   I wish they had read any books.   The library setting is only in a small part of the book.   Her friends are assholes.    I immediately downloaded my copy from Edelweiss when I saw it was available and I couldnt wait any longer. It was so worth it. Being locked in the library was a fantastic setting and it was great to see a character struggle with anxiety.;Kasie West

The whole promise of how a girl who has practically NO claim on the throne suddenly ends up on the throne was amazing.  2. This did end up in a story that is mostly based on politics. So if you are going into this book expecting more action you will be disappointed. I however appreciated this aspect and I thought the author did a great job with it. There is little detail about the worldbuilding though and some things just did not sit right with me but I could overlook it.  3. Freya immediately won my heart because she is a scientist like me. I love the fact she is more interested in working in the lab and that she is pretty pissed off that she cant spend all her time there after getting the throne.  4. There are healthy female friendships.  5. The romance was sortofcute but did not blow me away.  6. I liked the mystery behind the murder although the conclusion was a bit of a turnoff and the way Freya handled the murderer was.. weird.    The mystery behind the murder was great and I like the idea of a girl suddenly becoming Queen but the story did have some boring moments. It could have used a little more oomph.

The fact that there are people in the world who think like that is just unbelievable to me. Love  love no matter what as long as it makes you happy.

The other story is about a Queen and a Faun. She is possessed with the spirit of a girl that was strangled to death and she is now on the hunt to get justice.

If you are looking for an intricate contemporary book this is the one for you.  The story starts out in Kansas 2065. Adri is going to be one of the first people to live on Mars. Weeks before the launch she goes to live with Lily her old demented cousin. She discovers handwritten letters of the people who lived on the farm before Lily. She becomes intrigued by the story between Catherines mother Beth and Lenore.  Catherine lives in the fear and uncertainty of the Dust Bowl in Oklahoma 1934. The dust is threatening her sisters life Beezie. She first saves up to visit the Midnight Electric but when that doesnt have any effect on Beezies health Catherine decides she must take a bigger step. Beth is blind for the dangers and can think of one thing maintaining the farm.  Then we follow the life of Lenore in England 1919 during the recovery after the First World War. Her family deals with the grief after her brother passed away in the war. Her letters to Beth stay unanswered but she has set her mind on visiting Beth anyway.  The last two stories slowly entwine the close we get to the big answer what happened with all of them in the end Did Lenore and Beth ever meet Did Catherine and Beezie survive the dust We follow Adri on her small quest to find answers while she is preparing for her mission to Mars. I hate to say this but I really disliked Adri.. There was something so distant and unkind about her and she was quite the opposite of the sweet and talkative Lily. The story of Lenore was the most interesting to me.  The writingstyle is gorgeous like I am used to from Anderson but the story itself failed to impress me. In a way I think its because I didnt warm up to Adri and in another way it is because most of the story is told through letters. Its a different way to experience a story and I found it harder to connect with the characters and their lives.  Not bad but so far her books havent lived up to the amazing mindblowing and heartwrenching Tiger Lily.;Jodi Lynn Anderson

Its an easy and fast book but she has made Belle really unBellelike at times for the plot. Moments where I thought this is NOT how Belle would act but I tried to see this as a complete seperate story. You really have to overcome the idea that this is similar to Beauty and the Beast from Disney so once I let go of that it became more enjoyable.  The inclusion of DeathLove was interesting. I was confused by the first chapter yet intrigued by the way this was going to play out. It was an unique twist to add to the tale.  The plot would have benefited from more character building for the Beast but again the author probably did so for the plot. The whole story is driven by Belles unhappiness in the castle so the more lonely she gets the more desperate she wants to leave. The idea of traveling to this other world through a book was great it was one of the things I loved about the live 2017 version. The darker turn at the end was nicely done.  In the end it was enjoyable but not mindblowing and definitely not as close to the original tale as I thought it would be.;Jennifer Donnelly

Even more remarkably her classmates love her even though shes a supernerd and the teachers pet. But everything is not perfect in Matildas world. For starters she has two of the most idiotic selfcentered parents who ever lived. Then theres the large busty nightmare of a school principal Mrs. (The) Trunchbull a former hammerthrowing champion who flings children at will and is approximately as sympathetic as a bulldozer. Fortunately for Matilda she has the inner resources to deal with such annoyances astonishing intelligence saintly patience and an innate predilection for revenge.She warms up with some practical jokes aimed at her hapless parents but the true test comes when she rallies in defense of her teacher the sweet Miss Honey against the diabolical Trunchbull. There is never any doubt that Matilda will carry the day. Even so this wonderful story is far from predictable. Roald Dahl while keeping the plot moving imaginatively also has an unerring ear for emotional truth. The reader cares about Matilda because in addition to all her other gifts she has real feelings.;0;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Matilda;children;Bagian yang kusuka dari cerita ini adalah matilda yang suka membaca.  Karena ini cerita anak menurutku si penulis mengisahkan matilda secara simbolis.  Ya...begitulah aku memaknai kisah seru ini ketika membacanya di usia yang bukan termasuk anakanak lagi.  Seharusnya memang membaca membuka cara pandang terhadap kehidupan. Semakin banyak membaca semakin bisa melihat dari berbagai sudut pandang berbeda.  Dan matilda disini menjadi aneh..terlihat aneh bagi lingkungan sekitarnya.  Seperti juga aku yang merasa semakin membaca semakin terkucilkan dari lingkungan. Dianggap aneh dan terkadang bicara tak nyambung.  Ada saat kita tak perlu memamerkan segala kemampuan.  Cukup tahu dan ya...sudah. Memberi tahu orang lain yang belum saatnya tau apalagi memberi tahu pada orang yang tidak mau tahu hanya siasia.  Begitupun kemampuan membaca harusnya dapat menggerakkan.  Menggerakkan dalam kisah ini ditunjukkan dengan kemampuan Matilda menggerakkan benda dengan kekuatan mataberfikirnya.  Menggerakkan bagi ku adalah perubahan dalam aktifitas  lalu aktifitas yang melakukan perubahan.  Perubahan pada diri lalu perubahan pada sekitar.  Tapi toh..kutemukan banyak orang yang membaca namun tak merubah apapun pada dirinya.  apakah aku yang aneh  Bisa jadi kau akan merasa semakin sendirian.  Bisa jadi kau akan bertarung dengan orang yang sakit jiwa yang menyukai kondisi yang rusak dan suka merusak.  Tapi kisah matilda menegaskan kau akan bertemu dengan seseorang..  Kau tidak akan sendiri.  di suatu waktu disekitarmu akan kau temukan teman yang kau butuhkan.  teman bersama untuk berjuang.  begitulah cerita anak...  endingnya selalu bahagia bukan;Roald Dahl Quentin Blake

Blink is a book about how we think without thinking about choices that seem to be made in an instant  in the blink of an eye  that actually arent as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers while others are consistently inept Why do some people follow their instincts and win while others end up stumbling into error How do our brains really work  in the office in the classroom in the kitchen and in the bedroom And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to othersIn Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last based on a few minutes of observing a couple the tennis coach who knows when a player will doublefault before the racket even makes contact with the ball the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here too are great failures of blink the election of Warren Harding New Coke and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers arent those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating but those who have perfected the art of thinslicing  filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.Drawing on cuttingedge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make.

Their uncommon bond is torn by Amirs choice to abandon his friend amidst the increasing ethnic religious and political tensions of the dying years of the Afghan monarchy wrenching them far apart.

Sebagai buah karya pertama Khaled Hosseini patut diacungi jempol karena buku ini memuat banyak filosofi kehidupan dengan penyampaian yang mengalir dan tak menggurui.  Berkisah tentang perjalanan hidup Amir sejak kecil hingga dewasa. Dengan seting Afganisatan sebelum pada dan sesudah masa taliban. Amir bukanlah seorang anak pemberani dan mandiri ketika kecil haus kasih sayang ayah yang sangat maskulin.  Beberapa tindakan Amir kala masa kecilnya kadang juga kita lakukan membuat kita berkaca betapa kadang kita juga mencuri.  Mencuri. Satusatunya bentuk kejahatan yang berulangulang disindir dalam buku ini. Semua sumber kejahatan adalah mencuri. Ketika seseorang berbohong maka sesungguhnya Ia mencuri kesempatan orang lain untuk mendapat kebenaran.  Buku ini bercerita bahwa meski sederet dosa dilakukan hal tersebut adalah sebuah kewajaran sebagai manusia tak perlu menghukum diri seumur hidup dengan lari dari kenyataan sebenarnya. Amir melarikan diri dari rasa bersalah karena tak bisa menyelamatkan Hassan sahabat setianya (yang belakangan adalah saudara tirinya). Namun kembalinya dia ke afganistasn membuatnya harus melakukan perubahan besar terhadap dirinya sendiri. yaitu menebus rasa bersalahnya dengan menyelamatkan anak Hassan dari keganasan perang Taliban.  pesan yang sangat kusuka dari buku ini adalah  saat rasa bersalah menggerakkan seseorang melakukan kebaikan itulah penebusan dosa sejati.  Ayah amir memang melakukan kesalahan dengan menutupi keberadaan istri pertamanya dan hassan sebagai anak kandungnya namun dia berusaha menebusnya dengan mendirikan panti asuhan dan perbuatan amal baik. karena toh..masa lalu tak akan bisa di ulang kembali.  Hal itulah pelajaran terakhir yang di pelajari Amir dari Ayahnya dan dia meneruskannya dengan jujur pada dirinya sendiri.  Membaca buku ini aku sampai menangis terutama pada gambaran kekejaman taliban ketika Amir kembali ke afganistan sangat menyedihkan. Perbandingan antara gambaran afganistan di masa kecil Amir dan ketika masa taliban membuat pilu.  bagaimana bisa sebuah motivasi untuk menegakkan agama yang Rahmatan alamin bisa begitu penuh darah. . Menghacurkan peradaban dengan sehancurhancurnya.  Kenapa judulnya pengejar layanglayang  Pengejar layanglayang adalah garis merah dalam cerita ini. Budaya bermain dan mengejar layanglayang adalah simbol dimana suatu masa afganistan tidak memperdulikan ras dan agama syiah atau sunni tetapi hanya sebuah kebersamaan kegembiraan.  Sebuah masa dambaan seorang Amir...dan kupikir juga masamasa yang didambakan banyak orang.;Khaled Hosseini

Isi dari buku ini mengupas tentang Ekonomi Global dan perdagangan bebas.  Metodenya sederhana.  Bercerita tentang perjalanan hidup TShirt. Latar belakang pencarian kisah hidup TShirt tersebut diawali oleh kegusaran seorang profesor bisnis Pietra Rivolliterhadap celotehan aktifis yang menggugat perdagangan bebas. Dari mana dia(aktifis) tau.  Untuk membuktikan ocehan aktifs itu si Prof pun menggali asal muasal TShirt hingga sampai mana TShirt benarbenar habis terpakai.  Jika disederhanakan alur perjalanan hidup TShirt dimulai dari bentuk Kapas dari Amerika Serikat dipintal ditenun dan dijahit menjadi TShirt di Cina. Dipasarkan kembali ke AS. Singgah sebentar di lemari pakaian konsumen AS lalu ditampung atau dibeli dengan murah oleh salvation armylembaga sosial yang kemudian disalurkan ke negara miskin terutama Afrika. Di Afrika pakaian bekas ini berubah nama menjadi Mitumba.  Jika tak kandas menjadi Mitumba Tshirt dipotongpotong untuk jadi kain lap atau dicabik mutilator sampai menjadi shoddy yang berguna untuk pelapis bagian dalam atap mobil bantalan karpet atau dijalin ulang menjadi benang kualitas rendah kemudian diolah menjadi selimut murah yang dibagikan kepada para pengungsi.  Masalah yang membuat kapas mengalami perjalanan jauh hingga lintas negara itu adalah tenaga kerja. Meski kekuatan pertanian AS menurut buku ini setara dengan kekuatan Angkatan Bersenjatanya namun AS tidak mampu memenuhi kebutuhan sandang negaranya sendiri.  Jika Pertanian Kapas AS setelah berevolusi selama 200 tahun dapat dikelola secara mekanis dan membebaskan pertanian dari kejamnya perbudakan atau upah buruh yang rendah maka Industri tekstil adalah industri tetap banyak menyerap tenaga kerja. Dan tenaga kerja yang murah itu tidak ada di AS mereka ada di negaranegara dunia ketiga dan penguasanya adalah Cina. Dan siapakah tenaga kerja murah itu. Mereka adalah perempuanperempuan desa yang didiskriminasi oleh sistem Hokau pemerintah Cina. Mereka rela bekerja dengan upah rendah dan resiko keselamatan kerja tinggi dan jaminan kesejahteraan yang nyaris tak ada.  Perempuan tidak merasa buruk dengan ketertindasan itu. Bagi mereka keadaan itu masih lebih baik ketimbang hidup di desa dimana hidup mereka di kendalikan oleh orang lain. Bekerja di pabrik tekstil meski tertindas setidaknya mereka punya pilihan untuk menjadi diri sendiri. Dari memilih pakaian yang disukai hingga pasang hidup yang dicintai. Yuup...sangat berharganya sebuah jati diri...  Fase industri tekstil yang terjadi di Cina atau negara negara yang mengandalkan tenaga kerja murah adalah fase yang juga pernah dilalui oleh Negara maju seperti AS. Dan sama saja tetap bertumpu pada kaum perempuan. Alasannya pun sama rajin telaten dan mudah dikendalikan.  Ada produksi ada juga pasar. Keinginan menguasai produksi maupun pasar keinginan tenaga kerja untuk mendapatkan haknya secara utuh keinginan konsumen untuk dapat memuaskan kebutuhannya terhadap sandang hingga mode bermuara dalam politik sebagai alat. Semua kekuatan tarik menarik kepentingan. Siapa yang kuat dialah yang menang.    Menurutku Pietra Rivoli ini orang yang putus asa terhadap ide perdagangan bebas. Seperti quote di sampul bukunya Tak ada yang bebas dalam perdagangan bebas kecuali slogannya itulah benang merah setiap bagian dari kisah di buku ini.  Tak ada solusi dibuku ini. Yang ada hanya kisah.  Aku sendiri berhayal andai nih...Cina atau negaranegara yang saat ini mengobral tenaga kerja murah sampai pada tahap memberikan hak yang sama seperti apa yang didapat oleh tenaga kerja di negara maju apa mungkin perjalanan panjang sebuah TShirt akan menjadi ringkas.  Atau mungkinkah suatu saat nanti urusan sandang dunia_sebagai salah satu kebutuhan pokok ini dengan kemajuan teknologi yang lebih kemudian dapat dikelola secara mandiri. Seperti kearifan lokal Cina dimasa lalu dimana proses dari bahan mentah serat hingga berubah menjadi pakaian sepenuhnya dikelola secara mandiri oleh setiap rumah tangganya...  hmm....gimana menurutmu Prof.;Pietra Rivoli

As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them  in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul  they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and motherdaughter to each other and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation.

Selesai membaca buku ini aku jadi ingat sebuah dongeng tekateki siapa yang salah yang kudapat di beberapa pelatihan.  Kisahnya begini...  Ada sepasang kekasih harus berpisah karena tuntutan kehidupan. Sang Lelaki harus meninggalkan kampung halaman menunju negeri di seberang sungai besar. Tak tahan menahan rindu sang perempuan berniat menyusul. Namun terjebak dalam tipu daya dan harus menikah lebih dulu dengan Lelaki yang dapat memberikan tumpangan perahu untuk menyeberang sungai ke tempat kekasih yang dirindukannya berada. Setelah sepasang kekasih itu bertemu kembali kirakira apakah yang terjadi.  Jawaban yang diberikan dapat memperlihatkan sudut pandang seseorang tentang cinta dan penghargaan terhadap perempuan.  Buku ini menurutku menjawab dongeng tersebut.  Khaled Hoseini di novel ini tetap menggambarkan kejamnya perang di Afganistan. Jika dalam Kite Runner bertema tentang persahabatan maka di novel keduanya ini memotret kehidupan perempuan.Dan kisah perang selalu saja buram murung dan pilu.  Sebelum membaca novel ini pernah beberapa kali membaca artikel kondisi perempuan di Afganistan. Konon sebelum perang saudara dan taliban berkuasa perempuan Afganistan memiliki posisi penting. Di dunia Pendidikan Kesehatan hukum dan politik perempuan Afganistan hadir memberi kiprahnya. Dan ketika Taliban berkuasa Syariat Islam dikibarkan perempuan di tutup burqa di usir dari ranah publik. Tak berhak menikmati bebasnya udara diluar rumah kecuali dalam kawalan muhrimnya. Kondisi perang membuat kondisi semakin tak memihak perempuan. Banyak janda namun tak boleh bekerja mencari nafkah. Kesehatan perempuan minim fasilitas. Novel ini mengisahkannya kembali lewat kisah perih tokohtokoh ceritanya.  Seperti juga Kite Runner ceritanya mengalir dan membuat enggan berhenti hingga lembar terakhir. Namun kisah Kite Runner masih lebih berbekas di hati.  ;Khaled Hosseini

Into this conservative world with its social proprieties and established pecking order breezes Botchan down from the big city with scant respect for either his elders or his noisy young charges and the result is a chain of collisions large and small.Much of the story seems to occur in summer against the drone of cicadas and in many ways this is a summer book light funny never slowmoving. Here in a lively new translation much better suited to Western tastes than any of its forebears Botchans homespun appeal is all the more apparent and even those who have never been near the sunlit island on which these calamitous episodes take place should find in it uninterrupted entertainment.;172;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1356863952m169437.jpg;Botchan;fiction;aku juga melakukan beberapa kejailan saat di sekolah menengah tapi ketika para guru bertanya siapa yang bertangung jawab selayaknya lelaki aku selalu mengakuinya.

Meski berat hasil pemikiran Pangemanann dan Sepnya yang mirip kerja intelegen ini membuka wawasan menjawab penyebab kebencian Mingke pada peradaban feodal Jawa yang coba dikikisnya.  Kerja intelegent ini lah yang dianalogikan dengan Rumah Kaca yang dijadikan judul buku ini. Oleh Pangemanann setiap bibit tokoh pers dan organisasi di amati dan segera di cabut sebelum mengakar dan menggaruk kolonialisme Belanda. Disinilah tergambar jelas betapa besar pengaruh Raden Mas Mingke terhadap perubahan bangsa Indonesia.  Tema besar yang kutangkap dari buku ini adalah tentang kekuatan pers kekuatan pena kekuatan dari menulis. Dinamika peradaban akibat kekuatan tulisan berpadu dengan gerakan organisasi ternyata menjadi senjata ampuh merongrong kolonialisme Belanda dan perlahan membawa Indonesia pada perjuangannya untuk meraih kemerdekaan.  Buku ini berkisah tentang kekuatan tulisan di lawan dengan tulisan. Penulisnya bisa hidup karena tulisan bisa menghidupkan banyak orang bahkan bangsa tapi bisa juga membunuh kehidupan. Penulisnya bisa terpenjara karena tulisan bahkan bisa terbuang dan mati karena tulisan tapi tulisan pula yang membuat manusia mengabadi hidup dalam sejarah peradaban.  Tak perduli siapapun penulisnya meskipun penulisnya seorang pelacur sekalipun. Ketika tulisan menjadi milik umum tulisan tersebut memiliki kekuatan.  Pantas lah buku tetralogi buru ini sering di rekomendasikan oleh para penulis untuk di baca.  Atau karena hal ini pulalah maka buku ini sempat dilarang untuk di baca.

Ditulis berdasarkan kisah nyata.  Mengisahkan tentang tragedi akibat fanatisme agama di Bangladesh. Tragedi yang dipicu dari pembakaran mesjid Babri di Ayodya pada 6 desember 1992 di India oleh umat hindu.  Umat Islam di Bangladesh melakukan pembalasan ke umat hindu di negaranya. Rumah ibadah hindu di bakar. Tanah dan harta di rampas dan perempuanperempuannya di perkosa. Dan terjadilah migrasi besarbesaran umat hindu ke negara yang mayoritas hindu seperti India dan Sri Langka.  Sebagai yang beragama Islam membaca datadata di novel ini cukup bikin merinding Tak heran novel ini membuat penulis nya terusir dari negara nya sendiri.  Islam fundamentalis konon menghalalkan darahnya.  Namun kalau lebih diresapi buku ini sebenarnya tidak menghina Islam. Tapi memaki penganut Islam  Hindu fanatik yang menopengkan agama untuk menginjakinjak kemanusiaan.  Taslima Nasrin mencoba memasukkan kisah terbentuknya negara Bangladesh dari negara pecahan India dan Pakistan. Kemerdekaan yang diraih bersamasama tanpa melihat perjuangan merebut kemerdekaan adalah untuk satu penganut agama saja. Entah kenapa (tak jelas diuraikan di novel ini) Bangladesh kemudian memposisikan penganut agama Islam lebih istimewa di negara ini.  Potensi konflik antar agama kemudian mengakar mengancam dan di perparah dengan adanya jurang antara miskin dan kaya. Pembakaran Mesjid di India yang berakibat fatal di Bangladesh sebenarnya hanya puncak dari konflik yang harus mencari siapa yang lebih kuat dan berkuasa.  Sayang sekali novel ini lebih mirip pada kumpulan berita sehingga terkesan membosankan. Namun aku pikir buku ini penting di baca terutama orangorang yang fanatik agar bisa memahami akibat dari fanatisme buta.  Jangan langsung menarik diri karena Islam di buku ini memang sangat kejam..(mungkin seperti film fitna ya ) tapi pesan moral yang selalu di ulangulang di kisah buku ini...  Taslima Naslrin sesungguhnya menghujat agama..semua agama...tepatnya semua pemahaman pemeluk agama yang menumpahkan darah kemanusiaan.  di sampul akhir buku ini Taslima Nasrin berkata  Biarlah agama berganti nama menjadi Kemanusiaan  Yuup..bukankah agama ada untuk membawa kedamaian  tapi sejarah banyak mencatat tragedi kemanusiaan karena agama...  dan sampai kapan akan berlanjut ya;Taslima Nasrin Tutul Gupta

Buku ini sekaligus buku terakhir yang kubaca tentang kisah Minke alias Tirta Adi Surjo yang pada tahun 2006 lalu akhirnya diakui dengan gelar pahlawan Nasional. Acak.  Kisah di buku kedua ini menceritakan babak baru hidup Minke setelah ditinggal istrinya Annelies. Annelies yang patah hati semakin lemah dan jatuh sakit dalam perjalanan dan akhirnya meninggal di negeri moyangnya Netherland. Jauh dari orangorang yang dicintai dan mencintainya. Murung.  Juga cinta sebagaimana halnya setiap benda dan hal mempunyai bayangbayang. Dan bayangbayang cinta itu bernama derita. Tak ada satu hal pun tanpa bayangbayang kecuali terang itu sendiri.  Minke tetap tinggal bersama mertuanya Nyai Ontosoroh. Juga tak ingin hidup dalam bayangbayang Nyai Ontosoroh yang selalu dikaguminya_perempuan pribumi yang mampu mandiri dan menghujat kolonialisme. Tapi selalu saja ada masalah yang menahan Minke untuk melanjutkan sekolahnya ke Batavia sebagai dokter. Agaknya semua bermuara pada upaya perampasan hasil jerih payah Nyai dari keluarga almarhum Suaminya sekaligus pembunuh Annelies. Mereka terus berjuang mempertahankan haknya sampai akhirnya hanya bisa mengandalkan lisan saja.  Para sahabat Minke mengajaknya berkenalan dengan semangat pembaharuan selain eropa. Eropa yang selama ini satusatunya tempat dia memandang sebagai sebagai peradaban yang lebih tinggi mulai berhadapan oleh negaranegara di Asia yang berusaha menyaingi eropa.  Adanya Pengakuan Belanda terhadap Jbangsa epang yang dianggap setara dengan bangsa Eropa. Geliat Cina yang ingin menjadi Republik dan yang terdekat Philipina dengan Jose Rizalnya kemudian menjadi negara Republik yang pertama di Asia.  Seperti yang terekam dalam kata Khow Ah Soe_aktifis tionghoa yang terluntalunta demi citacita kaum muda bangsanya Kami harus serasikan Cina kami dengan kekuatan eropa tanpa menjadi eropa. Seperti halnya dengan Jepang.  Atau belajar dari Jepang dalam sebuah seminar  Setiap orang Jepang yang meninggalkan negerinya apakah dia kuli nenas di Hawaii apakah dia koki kapal bangsa lain apakah dia koki pada sebuah Mansion di San Fransisco apakah dia pelacur di kotakota besar di dunia semua mereka adalah jantung dan hati bangsa Jepang tidak bisa terpisahkan dari negerinya leluhurnya dan bangsanya.  Kelak mereka kembali ke negerinya membangun Jepang setara dengan Eropa.  Perubaahan bangsabangsa sekitar membuat Minke terheran heran. Belajar dari peradaban yang bukan eropa awalnya aneh baru dan tak terbayangkan bisa terjadi. Bagaimana sistem kerajaan mulai ditinggalkan dan berganti dengan republik. Revolusi perancis sebagaimana di eropa juga terjadi di Asia. Dan bentuk pemerintahan baru dicapai dengan istilah asing yang baru didengarnya yaitu bernama Organisasi.  Mungkin ini sebabnya judul buku ini menjadi anak semua bangsa ya  Karena memang banyak pembelajaran dari negara selain eropa. Bagai bayi semua bangsa dari segala jaman yang kemudian tumbuh. Dan kelak menjadi cikal bakal tumbuhnya nasionalisme di Indonesia.  Karir menulis Minke semakin menanjak. Tak hanya berbahasa Belanda dia juga ditantang menulis dalam bahasa Inggris. Tapi sahabatsahabat terdekatnya justru mendesaknya menulis dalam bahasa yang dianggapnya rendah. Bahasa bangsanya bukan bahasa Jawa tapi bahasa Melayu. Bahasa tanpa kasta.  Pada buku ketiga kelak bahasa inilah yang dipilih menjadi alat perjuangan alat propaganda dan pembentuk pendapat umum. Minke memperkuat bahasa melayu melalui surat kabar Medan Prijajinya. Bahasa iniah yang jadi cikal bakal pemersatu dan lahirnya Indonesia. Andai Minke menggunakan bahasa Jawa mungkin Indonesia pun tak pernah ada.  Sebelum menulis dalam bahasa Melayu Minke digugat untuk mengenal bangsanya sendiri. Baru saja hmulai menulis tentang bangsanya Minke membongkar kekejaman kapitalis Industri Gula di Tulangan Sidoarjo. Praktek perampasan tanah rakyat. Membuat bangsanya menjadi budak di tanah sendiri. Dan agaknya praktek ini masih juga tersisa hingga sekarang. Tak pemerintah maupun pemilik modal. Dengan alasan pembangunan mencaplok hutan dan tanah rakyat mengganti dengan tambang jalan tol atau apalah. Hasilnya rakyat tak juga sejahtera makin miskin. Tapi yang pasti memperkaya pemilik modal.  Pelajaran penting buat Minke yang akhirnya menyadari bahwa Surat kabar bisa memihak. Keberadaan surat kabar tempatnya bekerja ternyata untuk mengukuhkan kekuatan pemilik modal yang mendanai keberadaannya. Bangsanya harus membuat sendiri surat kabar yang menyuarakan kepentingan bangsanya.  Agaknya aktifis saat ini perlu kembali menyadari kembali hal ini ditengah derasnya Media massa saat ini. Benarkah berpihak pada Rakyat.  Seperti tema yang juga diangkat novel tetralogi buru lainnya buku kedua ini juga mengenalkan Tulisan sebagai kekuatan perubahan. Di belahan dunia manapun.  Setelah baca semua tetralogi pulau buru aku makin gak ngerti kenapa buku ini sempat dilarang. Ada pula yang beri cap buku kiri. Apa yang ditakutkan dari buku ini ya  Isinya tentang cikal bakal nasionalisme yang kelak menjelma menjadi Indonesia. Tentang kekuatan menulis dan perannya terhadap lahirnya Indonesia. Tentang kegerahan terhadap kolonialisme dan keingin berhenti dari kecanduan penjajahan. Tentang kemanusiaan. Tentang pencarian Jati diri bangsa. Tentang keinginan untuk berubah kemudian bersatu dan berjuang melalui organisasi dan pers.  Kupikir...cuma mental penjajah yang takut buku ini di baca orang banyak.;Pramoedya Ananta Toer Max Lane

Focusing on gender symbolism Sachiko Murata shows that Muslim authors frequently analyze the divine reality and its connections with the cosmic and human domains with a view toward a complementarity or polarity of principles that is analogous to the Chinese idea of yinyang.Murata believes that the unity of Islamic thought is found not so much in the ideas discussed as in the types of relationships that are set up among realities. She pays particular attention to the views of various figures commonly known as Sufis and philosophers since they approach these topics with a flexibility and subtlety not found in other schools of thought.

In her village as in so many others sex before marriage was considered a grave dishonour to ones family and was punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brotherinlaw was given the task of arranging her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the familys clothes he crept up on her poured petrol over her and set her alight.In the eyes of their community he was a hero. An execution for a crime of honour was a respectable duty unlikely to bring about condemnation from others. It certainly would not have provoked calls for his prosecution. More than five thousand cases of such honour killings are reported around the world each year and many more take place that we hear nothing about.Miraculously Souad survived rescued by the women of her village who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horrifically burned and abandoned by her family and community it was only the intervention of a European aid worker that enabled Souad to receive the care and sanctuary she so desperately needed and to start her life again. She has now decided to tell her story and uncover the barbarity of honour killings a practice which continues to this day.Burned Alive is a shocking testimony a true story of almost unbelievable cruelty. It speaks of amazing courage and fortitude and of one womans determination to survive.

Paling di penutup cerita saja alurnya sedikit cepat. Yang lainnya seperti paparan teka teki yang tak dijawab si penulis. Mungkin karena memang masa itu penuh dengan misteri atau si penulis juga kurang berani membeberkan analisa sejarahnya. Misalnya bagaimana Kwan bisa memiliki hubungan dengan Aidit yang membantu hamilton dapat mewawancarainya dan kemudian melambungkan nama Hamilton dan kwan di jajaran wartawan asing di Indonesia. Apakan ada hubungan antara Kumar yang PKI dengan Kwan dan siapa pula Vera si gadis rusia yang secara aneh dan menurutku maksa muncul di perjalanan Hamilton.  Ya begitu berbahayanya masa revolusi bagi keberadaan wartawan asing ternyata tetap saja membuat beberapa mereka jatuh hati pada Indonesia. Merasa lebih berarti atau harus berbuat lebih bagi Indonesia. Tapi Indonesia ya tetap Indonesia. Sepertinya bukan milik siapa siapa ya...termasuk bukan milik warga negaranya.  Untuk penulis asing yang mencoba menulis Indonesia harus diakui dia pandai melihat Indonesia sesungguhnya. Dan aku setuju lah dengan gambarannya tentang Indonesia di novel ini.

It presents a major African voice to American readers  a voice that prompted Peter Tinniswood to write in the London Times reviewing Gurnahs previous novel Mr. Gurnah is a very fine writer. I am certain he will become a great one. Paradise is Abdulrazak Gurnahs great novel. At twelve Yusuf the protagonist of this twentiethcentury odyssey is sold by his father in repayment of a debt. From the simple life of rural Africa Yusuf is thrown into the complexities of precolonial urban East Africa  a fascinating world in which Muslim black Africans Christian missionaries and Indians from the subcontinent coexist in a fragile subtle social hierarchy. Through the eyes of Yusuf Gurnah depicts communities at war trading safaris gone awry and the universal trials of adolescence. Then just as Yusuf begins to comprehend the choices required of him he and everyone around him must adjust to the new reality of European colonialism. The result is a pageturning saga that covers the same territory as the novels of Isak Dinesen and William Boyd but does so from a perspective never before available on that seldomchronicled part of the world.;256;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Paradise;fiction;Shortlisted for booker price and whitbred prize.  Itu logo di sampul depan buku yang kubaca yang tentu turut menyatakan bahwa buku ini punya keistimewaan.  Tokohnya bernama Yusuf. Dengan keistimewaan dan jalan hidup yang mirip dengan kisah Nabi Yusuf. Berwajah menawan terbuang dan kemudian bermasalah dengan perempuan karena kerupawanannya.  Lalu kenapa judulnya paradise. Kisah diawal novel menggambarkan impian tentang tempat didunia yang seindah paradise. Digambarkan sebagai tempat berupa taman yang cantik dan keindahan alam. Perjalanan hidup Yusuf kemudian membuatnya terbuang dari keluarga dan berhenti di sebuah rumah saudagar yang memiliki taman yang indah. Khayalan masa kecil membuat Yusuf terikat secara psikologis dengan taman tersebut. Yusuf selalu tertarik meluangkan waktu untuk merawat dan menjaga keindahan taman paradisenya. Dan aktifitas itu kemudian membuatnya didekati oleh istri si saudagar yang terpesona dengan kerupawanannya.  Alurnya memang sangat datar. Bahkan terkesan berteletele. Kisah novel ini mengambil seting kehidupan perdagangan antar bangsa berbeda bahasa dan budaya menjelang era kolonialisme bangsa eropa. Yang menarik adalah tujuan dari si saudagar_majikan Yusuf dalam berdagang. Ada misi menyebarkan agama di dalamnya. Tidak semata untuk keuntungan bisnis.  Berbeda dengan kisah nabi Yusuf pesan dari kisah si Yusuf dalam novel ini adalah Kebebasan.  Yusuf diasuh oleh si Saudagar untuk melunasi hutang ayah Yusuf. Yusuf bekerja secara gratis kepada si Saudagar alias menjadi budak secara sukarela. Dan yusuf tidak sendirian ada Khalil temannya yang juga bernasib sama. Hidup menghamba pada sang saudagar karena hutang orang tua. Demikian juga Amina perempuan yang dicintai Yusuf saudara angkat Khalil yang menjadi istri kedua sang Saudagar. Ada pula Mzee Hamdani budak yang setia merawat kebun sang Saudagar meski telah lama dia diberi kebebasan untuk lepas dari status sebagai budak.  Mereka sebenarnya bisa saja lepas dari nasib sebagai budak sang Saudagar. Tapi kebebasan bukan masalah tembok dinding bangunan yang memenjara diri. Tembok penjara sebenarnya ada di pikiran.  Seperti kisah Nabi Yusuf Yusuf di novel ini pun kemudian di rayu si Istri Saudagar hingga bajunya terkoyak. Aib dan bahaya mengancam Yusuf. Dan selanjutnya kisah sedikit berbeda dari kisah Sang Nabi Yusuf dimaafkan.  Namun Yusuf merasa terdesak dengan hutang budi ketika Sang Saudagar baginya pemberian maaf itu berselubung dengan penghambaan seumur hidup di simbolkan penulis dengan anjing yang memakan kotoran majikannya. Yusuf dalam pilihan tetap seperti anjing atau masuk menjadi pasukan perang orang Eropa yang sangat asing baginya.  Ketika semua orang di desa memilih mengurung diri bersembunyi dari orang Eropa yang terkenal kejam Yusuf memilih kebebasannya. Sepintas terlihat nasib Yusuf seperti keluar dari mulut Harimau masuk ke mulut Buaya. Tapi itulah paradise baginya dan bukan taman indah bagai surga milik saudagar yang selama ini mengikatnya. Paradise adalah ketika Yusuf bisa melihat bahwa dia tetap punya pilihan. Paradise adalah kebebasan.  Syukurlah bagian akhir buku ini mengobati kebosananku dari kedataran ceritanya.;Abdulrazak Gurnah

Yeay...harus dirayakan sepertinya D  Penulis yang punya nama besar bikin penasaran sejak lama. Apa sih kerennya.  Well..novel ini lumayan tebal untuk cerita kucingkucingan. Pencarian seorang belahan jiwa yang telah lama terpisah. Murakami memasukkan tokoh misterius agama misterius dan Alam yang misterius pula. Imajinatif. Karena itulah ceritanya mengalir dan membuat penasaran dan Menghanyutkan.Lembarlembar terlewati hingga endingnya aku cuma bisa tarik nafas bingung dan kesal. Ini cerita tetang apa sih  wkwkwk..  Ada tokohtokoh dan kisah yang menggantung. Yang membuatku mengira ini novel ada beberapa bagian. Harusnya ada kisah sebelum novel ini yang menceritakan bagaimana Tango dan Aomame terpisah. Bagaimana Aomame bisa terjebak di IQ84.  Harusnya ada kisah setelah novel ini yang menceritakan Bagaimana dunia IQ84 berjalan setelah Tango dan Aomame bisa melarikan diri. Apakah sekte agama aneh itu bisa bertahan.  Yeah...endingnya happy ending karena kedua tokohnya akhirnya bersatu sekaligus nyebelin karena cerita yang menggantung.  Perlu beberapa waktu aku berfikir apalah pembelajaran dari novel tebal ini  Dan setelah kudapatkan baru bisa kutuliskan review ini.  Novel ini bercerita tentang kematian.  Tokoh dalam cerita tak ada yang takut mati. Semua siap mati dengan caranya masingmasing. Ada yang mempersiapkannya sampai sangat detail. Ada yang hanya bertahan sampai waktunya mati. Ada yang membunuh dan ada pula yang minta di bunuh.  Persiapan kematian yang berbedabeda. Beberapa malah sendu. Seolah kehidupan indah hanya milik orangorang tertentu. Cerita yang buram dibalik Cerita cinta yang indah. Itukah dunia dengan dua Bulan  Ish....Murakami...nyebelin tapi bikin penasaran membaca bukunya lagi.;Haruki Murakami Jay Rubin Philip Gabriel

Even so he never expects to meet Hilal. A gifted young violinist she is the woman Paulo loved five hundred years beforeand the woman he betrayed in an act of cowardice so farreaching that it prevents him from finding real happiness in this life. Together they will initiate a mystical voyage through time and space traveling a path that teaches love forgiveness and the courage to overcome lifes inevitable challenges. Beautiful and inspiring Alephinvites us to consider the meaning of our own personal journeys.;288;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1344370504m13573214.jpg;Aleph;fiction;Aleph Novel traveling kelas berat )  Apa yang kau cari dalam sebuah perjalanantraveling  Pemandangan yang indah Petualangan Suasana baru atau belanja  Cobalah perjalanan melewati transsiberian railway. Jalur kereta api terpanjang didunia. Melintasi dua Benua Asia dan Eropa. Dari Moscow hingga ke Vladivostok yang berarti  perjalanan menempuh 9288 kilometer melewati 7 zona waktu berbeda memakan waktu perjalanan hampir satu bulan. Didalam Kereta Api.  Awalnya aku lebih terpesona dengan rute perjalananan raksasanya. Begitu panjang dan menantang. Maka kucobalah mengintip Aleph setelah dikenalkan lewat ngobrolngobrol seru dengan temanteman penikmat buku tentang novel yang mengambil setting perjalanan di jalur ini. Kucaricari biaya perjalanan gila itu...dan wow..harganya mencengangkan. Sepertinya gak akan rela juga merogoh kocek sendiri )  Kubacalah novel ini sembari menikmati perjalanan kereta api. Setidaknya walau tak menjalani traveling dengan tran siberian railway setidaknya masih terasa suasana ceritanya. Diayun oleh goncangan kereta api yang khas. )  Seperti novel Paulo Coelho lainnya Aleph juga dihiasi oleh kutipankutipan yang membuatku tak tahan untuk tidak melipat lembaranlembarannya. Maafkan aku...karena selalu lupa membawa sticky note sebagai penanda bagian yang kusuka. Tapi aku tak mau kehilangan moment katakata dalam buku ini. Meski....Alchemist masih jauh lebih menyihir daripada Aleph.  Sebegitu raksasanya rute perjalanan ternyata Aleph adalah misi perjalanan mengenal diri sendiri sang tokoh ceritanya. Aneh ya...begitu besar perjuangan si tokoh untuk mengenal diri sendiri.  Aleph diartikan sebagai titik dimana segala sesuatu berada di tempat dan waktu yang sama. Dalam bahasa arab Aleph adalah huruf Alif. dalam budha disebut Qi. Paulo Coelho mengaitkannya dengan konsep inkarsi. Kita adalah seseorang di masa lalu dan menyelesaikan dosadosa yang tak tuntas di kehidupan berikutnya. Aleph adalah saat seluruh masamasa itu bersatu. Beberapa sumber agama dikaitkan oleh Paulo Coelho dibuku ini aku mangutmangut ketika dia menyatakan Islam juga memiliki konsep inkarnasi. Qs 228 dan Qs 2154. Paulo Coelho memang lihai menarik kisahkisah berbagai agama seolah memiliki konsep yang sama. Islam Kristen dan Budha ada ditemukan dalam novel ini.  Alur ceritanya seperti gambaran perjalanan dalam kereta api. Bayangkan aja berada dalam gerbong kereta api selama 10 hari. Hufft....5 jam perjalanan Medan Rantau Prapat saja sudah cukup membosankan. Untuk cerita bertema inkarnasi sepertinya bisa jauh lebih seru. Seseru kisah santiago yang tak tertebak dalam alchemist.  Begitupun aku suka buku ini. Mungkin karena sedang moody membaca tulisan yang mesti dilumat berulangulang sebelum di telan. Banyak hal yang menarik. Novel ini bagiku lebih tepat jadi buku tentang pemikiran saja. Kisah romantis inkarnasi dan kisah kotakota yang disinggahi di rute itu...bagiku terlalu biasa. Namun kutipan pemikirannya...benarbenar menjadikan buku ini penuh lipatan. )  ku kutip beberapa yaa....   dalam kasusku membaca jelas sangat penting namun siapa pun yang menaruh seluruh kepercayaannya pada bukubuku tebal akademis serta kursuskursu menulis kreatif kehilangan ini semuanaya Katakada adalah kehidupan yang dituangkan ke atas kertas. Jadi carilah temanteman   Kenapa selama berbulanbulan ini aku mengeluh soal kehilangan kotak dengan Energi Ilahi Omong kosong apa itu. Kita selalu terhubung dengan Energi Ilahi Rutinitaslah yang membuat kita tak merasakannya.  dan kutipan romantis buat merayu )   Aku mencintaimu seperti sungai yang memberikan air pada yang haus dan mengantar orangorang kemanapun tempat mereka tuju.  Aku mencitaimu seperti sungai yang dimulai dengan tetesan tetesan sepi di pegunungan lalu pelan pelan bergabung dengan sungai lain sampai pada satu titik sungai itu dapat mengalir melewati hambatan apapun untuk mencapai tujuannya  aku mencintaimu seperti sungai yang tidak bisa menjelaskan kenapa ia mengikuti alur tertentu dan hanya terus mengalir. Cinta yang tidak meminta dan memberikan apaapa sungai yang hanya hadir apa adanya.    Jadi apakah aku bisa menemukan Aleph ya;Paulo Coelho Margaret Jull Costa

Nombeko was fated to grow up fast and die early in her povertystricken township be it from drugs alcohol or just plain despair. But Nombeko takes a different path. She finds work as a housecleaner and eventually makes her way up to the position of chief advisor at the helm of one of the worlds most secret projects. Here is where the tale merges with then diverges from reality. South Africa developed six nuclear missiles in the 1980s then voluntarily dismantled them in 1994.This is the story of the seventh missile the one that was never supposed to have existed. Nombeko Mayeki knows too much about it and now shes on the run from both the South African justice system and the most terrifying secret service in the world.

However it was these early stories that first earned her a reputation as a writer with the liveliest imagination and most delicate style of her time. Influenced by Joyce Proust and the theories of William James Bergson and Freud she strove to write a new fiction that emphasized the continuous flow of consciousness times passage as both a series of sequential moments and a longer flow of years and centuries and the essential indefinability of character.Readers can discover these and other aspects of her influential style in the eight stories collected here among them a delightful feminist putdown of the male intellect in A Society and a brilliant and sensitive portrayal of nature in Kew Gardens. Also included are An Unwritten Novel The String Quartet A Haunted House Blue  Green The Mark on the Wall and the title story.In recent years Woolfs fiction feminism and highminded sensibilities have earned her an evergrowing audience of readers.

Americas industrialists go on strike to protest the mooching of the government and the Looters while the countrys attempts at economic equality cause it to suffer the consequences of socialism and the redistribution of wealth. The book is quite long but it didnt feel like it because the characters are welldefined and the plot keeps moving. I recommend it if youre interested in business economics or politics.  Ive always been an advocate of capitalism and small government so I agreed with the basic political and economic philosophy. The book consists of several intertwining stories stretching over many years they feature envy jealousy political wrangling and glimpses into the lifestyles of high society. Because of the topic the story is serious and there are few humorous parts. The end is appropriate for closing the story but it was anticlimactic.  Especially near the end the story goes too far in defending materialism and becomes downright antispiritual. The moral is that your own life is your only value and your own happiness is your only purpose (achieved through your work).  Themes  Socialism results in a cannibalistic dysfunctional economy because everyone starts mooching off everyone else. It disincentivizes achievement and success. From each according to his ability to each according to his need fails. Free trade works best when people work in their selfinterest without a sense of social responsibility.  People are accountable for their intelligence and responsibility. Incompetence is frustrating and its difficult to find people of talent and action.  Life is purposeful motion. You must be taking action and moving forward not stagnating.  The lower and middle classes demonize the rich because they dont understand them. They see the rich as selfish and greedy not as people whove earned their way. They use their sense of need as a claim on the earned property of the rich.  The lower and middle classes think the government has all the answers. They think that if it wasnt for the profitseekers who hampered the governments plans the country would be prosperous. In reality government exists to protect from violence the citizens who pay for it (taxpayers).  Antibusiness legislation  A main theme in the book is the governments interference in private trade and the economy. There are many backroom deals between businessmen and Washington and no shortage of antibusiness legislation.  The Fair Share Law dictates that businesses cant choose who to do business with. They must fill orders from everyone regardless of profitability.  The Antidogeatdog Rule forbids competition between railroads in the same geographic area supposedly to prevent destructive competition but the actual purpose is to hurt one railroad company.  The Equalization of Opportunity bill stipulates that a person can only own one business and is used by the Looters to seize others businesses for themselves.  The Unification Board seeks to centralize and socialize the economy it says that people cant quit or change jobs and no new patents can be issued. These laws are supposedly passed to prevent businesses from wasting resources on competition. The rationale is that a centralized command and control economy is more efficient than a competitive one.  Defense of capitalism  Several characters make speeches in defense of capitalism. Henry Rearden defends himself in court refusing to apologize for his ability success and wealth.  My favorite speech was one by Francisco dAnconia where he declares that money is not the root of evil its a tool for exchanging value. It allows people to trade effort instead of using force. But money is more than a tool its a token of honor he says wealth is the product of mans capacity to think and that money is made by the effort of every honest man each to the extent of his ability. Money is made possible only by those who produce its a product of effort not of the moochers or looters. dAnconia praises the concept of the selfmade man the American industrialist who replaced swordsmen and slaves. He also admires the American invention of the concept of making money people used to think of wealth as static and economics as a zerosum game but America defined the dynamic generation of wealth that benefits all economic participants.;Ayn Rand Leonard Peikoff

At Andrew Carnegies bidding he spent 20 years interviewing and studying over 500 people including Henry Ford John Rockefeller Thomas Edison Marshall Field Charles Schwab and Alexander Graham Bell.  Did I discover the secret that will launch me to worldrenowned success Unfortunately not that Im aware. Do I have a better understanding of the psychology behind success or failure Yes. I also realize how important it is to set a high goal review it daily and constantly work toward it.  Quick summary Anybody can wish for riches and most people do but only a few know that a definite plan plus a burning desire for wealth are the only dependable means of accumulating it.  The book contains a lot of practical advice on being successful but its mainly focused on the psychological motivation behind it. Although most of its sound there are some sections that are of questionable scientific validity and some pure pseudoscience. For example Hill believes that all human brains are connected by the vibrating energy of thought and that people can connect to the Infinite Intelligence  a cosmic force permeating all matter and energy.  Other nonsense presented as fact telepathy clairvoyance ESP precognition. These parts reminded me of some of the pseudoscience in The Power of Positive Thinking. At first I was concerned about Hills mental state and ability to separate fact from fantasy when he described his imaginary meetings with a group of notable dead and living men he called his Invisible Counselors. On second thought however I can see how imagining the advice that great people might give could help you make better decisions.  Here are the 13 Steps to Riches presented in the book supposedly containing the great secret to wealth  13 Steps to Riches  1. Desire  Have a burning desire for something definite (money etc.).  Create a plan to obtain a definite amount of money through the sale of specific goods and services by a set date.  See and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money.  2. Faith  Believe in your idea.  Your selfconfidence will influence your thoughts and actions.  3. Autosuggestion  Concentrate on your desire and faith and your subconscious will create practical plans for obtaining your desiremoney.  4. Specialized knowledge  Use your expertise and imagination to come up with ideas that earn far more than any job.  5. Imagination  Hard work and honesty alone wont make you rich.  Ideas become money through a definite purpose plus a definite plan.  Form definite plans to turn your ideas into money.  6. Organized planning  Create a practical plan for acquiring money.  Provide great service and convince others that youre worth the money you demand.  Follow the QQS Formula for service   Quality be efficient and increase in efficiency   Quantity give all the service you can and improve through practice and experience   Spirit be agreeable and harmonious with others  7. Decision  Make decisions quickly and definitely change them slowly.  Base decisions on your desire and your own opinions (not others).  8. Persistence  Have the willpower to follow your desire and plans despite obstacles and criticism.  9. Master Mind  Surround yourself with likeminded intelligent people. This is your brain trust or think tank.  With your Master Mind group coordinate your knowledge and effort to attain your desire.  10. Sex transmutation  Channel your sexual energy into creative energy.  Limit yourself to a moderate amount of sex and use your remaining energy to drive creativity and enthusiasm.  11. Subconscious mind  Plant your desires in your subconscious for it to work toward 247.  Fill your mind with positive emotions so that negative ones cant enter.  12. The brain  Send thoughts with your subconscious receive thoughts with your creative imagination and use autosuggestion.  13. Sixth Sense  Meditate to become attuned to inspiration and creative imagination.  Other notes  Dont expect poverty demand riches.  The only thing you can absolutely control in life is your thoughts. Control your mind through selfdiscipline and habit.  Dont use the basic fears as excuses overcome them through positive thinking  fears of poverty criticism illness loss of love old age and death. Dont worry and dont be susceptible to negative influences.  My favorite part of the book was the poem in the Desire chapter My Wage by Jessie Belle Rittenhouse  I bargained with Life for a penny  And Life would pay no more  However I begged at evening  When I counted my scanty store  For Life is a just employer  He gives you what you ask  But once you have set the wages  Why you must bear the task.  I worked for a menials hire  Only to learn dismayed  That any wage I had asked of Life  Life would have willingly paid.;Napoleon Hill

925;1097;3;50548;0060838582;A groundbreaking work of investigation and cultural history that may change the way America thinks about the way it eats.Are we what we eat To a degree both engrossing and alarming the story of fast food is the story of postwar America. Though created by a handful of mavericks the fast food industry has triggered the homogenization of our society. Fast food has hastened the malling of our landscape widened the chasm between rich and poor fueled an epidemic of obesity and propelled the juggernaut of American cultural imperialism abroad.Thats a lengthy list of charges but Eric Schlosser makes them stick with an artful mix of firstrate reportage wry wit and careful reasoning. Schlossers mythshattering survey stretches from the California subdivisions where the business was born to the industrial corridor along the New Jersey Turnpike where many of fast foods flavors are concocted. He hangs out with the teenagers who make the restaurants run and communes with those unlucky enough to hold Americas most dangerous job  meatpacker. He travels to Las Vegas for a giddily surreal franchisers convention where Mikhail Gorbachev delivers the keynote address. He even ventures to England and Germany to clock the rate at which those countries are becoming fast food nations.Along the way Schlosser unearths a trove of fascinating unsettling truths  from the unholy alliance between fast food and Hollywood to the seismic changes the industry has wrought in food production popular culture and even real estate. He also uncovers the fast food chains efforts to reel in the youngest most susceptible consumers even while they hone their institutionalized exploitation of teenagers and minorities. Schlosser then turns a critical eye toward the hot topic of globalization  a phenomenon launched by fast food.

Many of the gods heroes places and events are referenced throughout Western art and literature. Some of the characters include Helen Achilles Hector Odysseus and the Greek pantheon (Zeus Poseidon Hades Apollo Athena et al.).  Recurring themes are winning glory in battle even in death and in the inevitability of fate.

Here one of the great modern translators presents us with The Odyssey Homers bestloved poem recounting Odysseus wanderings after the Trojan War. With wit and wile the man of twists and turns meets the challenges of the seagod Poseidon and monsters ranging from the manyheaded Scylla to the cannibalistic Cyclops Polyphemus  only to return after twenty years to a home besieged by his wife Penelopes suitors. In the myths and legends retold in this immortal poem Fagles has captured the energy of Homers original in a bold contemporary idiom.Seven greek cities claim the honour of being the birthplace of Homer (c. 8th7th century BC) the poet to whom the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey are attributed. The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Western literature but the identity  or even the existence  of Homer himself is a complete mystery with no reliable biographical information having survived.If you enjoyed The Odyssey you might like Robert Fagles translation of The Iliad also available in Penguin Classics.Wonderfully readable ...

It records the adventures of Ulysses (AKA Odysseus) one of the heroes of the Trojan War as he makes his way home to Ithaca. Ulysses is cunningly crafty and sometimes manipulative forges friendships and alliances and plots vengefully against his enemies.  There arent as many familiar characters here as in The Iliad but theres a wider range of cultures since the tale follows Ulysses travels to many lands. A few memorable creatures include the cyclops Polyphemus the sirens and the sea monster Scylla.  One major theme is being a good host providing shelter food clothing and aid to those in need. Another is loyalty Ulysses sometimes in disguise questions many to find out whether theyre for or against him and his family. He remembers both friends and foes when he finally returns home and deals with them accordingly.  As in The Iliad the Olympian deities choose sides in human affairs. Minerva guides Ulysses in his homeward journey and assists and Ulysses son Telemachus in preparing Ithaca for Ulysses return. Neptune however attempts to foil Ulysses plans since Ulysses injured Neptunes son the cyclops Polyphemus. Theres a connection to The Iliad when Ulysses visits Hades and speaks to the dead many of whom are familiar heroes of the Trojan War.

Im a small business owner (a selfemployed web designer OptimWise) who relies on wordofmouth so this topic was particularly relevant.  I also liked his point that when it comes to providing new ideas weak ties (such as acquaintances) are more important than strong ties (such as friends). Strong ties inhabit the same world as we do weak ties dont so they introduce us to new ideas.  I found it interesting that Gladwell said that although muchmaligned BandAid solutions arent bad theyre cheap simple and effective.  I liked the heavily abridged audiobook enough that I later listened to the unabridged version. Both are narrated by Gladwell.  Three Rules  The Law of the Few  Connectors mavens and salespeople start wordofmouth epidemics.  Connectors know a lot of people and introduce them to others.  Mavens introduce and provide information to a lot of people.  Salesmen charismatically persuade and negotiate.  Six degrees of separation doesnt mean that were all linked in 6 steps but that a very few people are linked to everyone else and everyone else is linked through them.  The Stickiness Factor  Change the way you present information to make it more sticky.  The Power of Context  Were influenced by our surroundings and the people around us.  Changing the size of a group can make it more receptive to ideas.  The rule of 150 most people can have about 150 real social relationships.;Malcolm Gladwell

As the title states every websites design and functionality should be so simple that people barely need to think to use it. The books 2nd edition is from 2005 so some examples are dated but the concepts are quite relevant. This was a fun read due to its straightforward style and Krugs humor.  When I started looking for web design books Steve Krugs classic on web usability frequently appeared at the top of most lists along with Designing with Web Standards by Jeffrey Zeldman (see my review). I highly recommend both books.  Steve Krugs Laws of Usability  First Law Dont make me think. Make things obvious and selfevident or at least selfexplanatory. People scan they dont read. People choose the first reasonable option. People muddle through things rather than figure them out.  Second Law It doesnt matter how many times I have to click as long as each click is a mindless unambiguous choice. Make choices mindless for ease of use.  Third Law Get rid of half the words on each page then get rid of half of whats left. Be ruthlessly concise.  Usability testing  Test early and often. Test with 3 or 4 users. Have each user think out loud as they use the site. Use a screen recorder to record the session for reference. Fix any problems then test again. Review the results as soon as possible.  Additional notes  Navigation helps users find things tells them where they are reveals content and tells how to use the site. It must be good enough to help people who land on any page.  The home page should have a personable lively tagline conveying a value proposition. The home page also needs a short scannable welcome blurb describing the site.  Know what people want and make those things obvious and easy.  Only ask for information necessary to complete the transaction.  Only make a site look good if its not at the expense of making it work well.;Steve Krug

Although I generally agree with his principles I think Carnegie makes following them sound too easy.  Carnegie states that 15 of success is due to technical knowledge and the other 85 is due to personality and leadership. He says that the 1 secret to success in dealing with people is having a sympathetic grasp of the other persons point of view. He talks a lot about respecting and understanding other people and quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that I learn of him.  Carnegie also talks a lot about praise he says that praise is more effective than criticism for changing behavior and winning people over so you should be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.  The book includes lessons from people like Jesus Confucius Buddha Abraham Lincoln Andrew Carnegie Ben Franklin John Rockefeller Charles Schwab and J.P. Morgan. Carnegie provides anecdotes of his own experiences and those of the people who took his courses.  I first read this book when coworkers suggested I improve my social skills because I received many recommendations for this book. I reread it because the lessons are so important and worthwhile.  Below are the books principles along with my notes.  Fundamental Techniques in Handling People  1. Dont criticize condemn or complain.   Criticism is futile.  2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.   Avoid flattery.  3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.   Salespeople need to show how their products and services solve customers problems   Each party should gain there must be mutual benefit.  Six Ways to Make People Like You  1. Become genuinely interested in other people.   You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you   Greet people with animation and enthusiasm. When someone calls on the phone sound like youre pleased.  2. Smile.   A facial expression is more important than clothes.   Encouragement is more effective than punishment.   Dont feel like smiling Force yourself feeling follows action.  3. Remember that a mans Name is to him the sweetest and most important sound in any language.   To remember names tie the name to a persons features use the persons name in conversation and write and memorize the name.  4. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.   To be a good conversationalist listen and pay attention.   To be interesting be interested.  5. Talk in the terms of the other mans interest.  6. Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely.   The law of human conduct always make the other person feel important.   Follow the Golden Rule Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking  1. Avoid arguments.   You cant win an argument. Even if you win you make your opponent feel inferior so you lose.  2. Show respect for the other persons opinions. Never tell someone they are wrong.  3. If youre wrong admit it quickly and emphatically.  4. Begin in a friendly way.   A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. So with men. If you would win a man to your cause first convince him that you are his sincere friend.  Lincoln  5. Start with questions the other person will answer yes to.   The more yeses you can get at the outset the more likely the person is to accept your ultimate proposal.  6. Let the other person do the talking.   If you want enemies excel your friends but if you want friends let your friends excel you.  7. Let the other person feel the idea is hishers.  8. Try honestly to see things from the other persons point of view.  9. Sympathize with the other person.  10. Appeal to noble motives.   Treat people as if they are honest and fair.  11. Dramatize your ideas.  12. Throw down a challenge.   Use showmanship when selling or convincing.  Be a Leader How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment  1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.   Use and not but as your conjunction between praise and criticism. Give praise then say and then give criticismcorrection. Dont give praise say but then criticize it cheapens the praise.  2. Call attention to other peoples mistakes indirectly.  3. Talk about your own mistakes first.  4. Ask questions instead of directly giving orders.   People are more likely to accept an order if they had a part in the decision.  5. Let the other person save face.  6. Praise every improvement.   Give specific sincere praise.   Praise is more effective at changing behavior than criticism.  7. Give them a fine reputation to live up to.   Praise people and theyll feel obligated to live up to their good reputation.  8. Encourage them by making their faults seem easy to correct.  9. Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.   Convince people by telling them specifically how theyll personally benefit.;Dale Carnegie

I had high hopes for this book because of its reputation and listing as 9 out of 100 on NPRs Top 100 ScienceFiction Fantasy Books but it let me down. I simply didnt care about any of the characters and found it boring until chapter 16 which records an extensive philosophical debate.  Its set in a future where the world government engineers and clones humans organizes them into castes from birth provides perpetual youth and gives rations of soma a hallucinogen that removes stress and discomfort. The government promotes selfindulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. The civilization has given up art science and religion in exchange for happiness.  The mindless entertainment of the populace reminded me of Fahrenheit 451 (my review). The totalitarian government and ignorant sheeple reminded me of 1984 (my review). I liked both those books significantly more than this one.  My favorite part was the conversation between John the Savage and Mustapha Mond Resident World Controller for Western Europe in chapters 16 and 17. Their conversation gets to the heart of what this book is about. Mond tells how the civilization has done away with art science and religion. Ill start excerpting where Mond is explaining why Shakespeare is prohibited.Because its old thats the chief reason. We havent any use for old things here.  Even when theyre beautiful  Particularly when theyre beautiful. Beautys attractive and we dont want people to be attracted by old things. We want them to like the new ones.  Because our world is not the same as Othellos world. You cant make flivvers without steeland you cant make tragedies without social instability. The worlds stable now. People are happy they get what they want and they never want what they cant get. Theyre well off theyre safe theyre never ill theyre not afraid of death theyre blissfully ignorant of passion and old age theyre plagued with no mothers or fathers theyve got no wives or children or lovers to feel strongly about theyre so conditioned that they practically cant help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong theres soma. Which you go and chuck out of the window in the name of liberty Mr. Savage. Liberty He laughed. Expecting Deltas to know what liberty is And now expecting them to understand Othello My good boy  But thats the price we have to pay for stability. Youve got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. Weve sacrificed the high art. We have the feelies and the scent organ instead.  We dont want to change. Every change is a menace to stability. Thats another reason why were so chary of applying new inventions. Every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive.  Whats the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all around you That was when science first began to be controlledafter the Nine Years War. People were ready to have even their appetites controlled then. Anything for a quiet life. Weve gone on controlling ever since. It hasnt been very good for truth of course. But its been very good for happiness.  You can only be independent of God while youve got youth and prosperity independence wont take you safely to the end. Well weve now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. What follows Evidently that we can be independent of God. The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses. But there arent any losses for us to compensate religious sentiment is superfluous. And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires when youthful desires never fail A substitute for distractions when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity of consolation when we have soma of something immovable when there is the social order;Aldous Huxley

The tale of Dorian Grays moral disintegration caused a scandal when it first appeared in 1890 but though Wilde was attacked for the novels corrupting influence he responded that there is in fact a terrible moral in Dorian Gray. Just a few years later the book and the aestheticmoral dilemma it presented became issues in the trials occasioned by Wildes homosexual liaisons which resulted in his imprisonment. Of Dorian Grays relationship to autobiography Wilde noted in a letter Basil Hallward is what I think I am Lord Henry what the world thinks me Dorian what I would like to bein other ages perhaps.;254;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1424596966m5297.jpg;The Picture of Dorian Gray;fiction;This classic includes themes of vanity obsession with youth and beauty manipulation and influence and sin and corruption. I was a bit underwhelmed given this storys reputation. I found it too long and some parts didnt seem to contribute to the story such as the descriptions of Dorians art collection and the lengthy descriptions of historical people. The writing is great and I was amused by the details of Victorian life displayed by Lord Henry and Dorian (dress pastimes speech).  An excellent commentary on the story is Lord Henrys quotation of the preacher citing Mark 836 What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul  I listened to free Project Gutenburg audiobook.  Quotes  The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it. Resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.  There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about.  Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.  When one is in love one always begins by deceiving ones self and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.  Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship and it is by far the best ending for one.  Always That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.  Because to influence a person is to give him ones own soul.  To realize ones nature perfectlythat is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties the duty that one owes to ones self.  The terror of society which is the basis of morals the terror of God which is the secret of religionthese are the two things that govern us.;Oscar Wilde Jeffrey Eugenides

939;5571;2;50548;0865475873;Reduce reuse recycle urge environmentalists in other words do more with less in order to minimize damage. But as architect William McDonough and chemist Michael Braungart point out in this provocative visionary book such an approach only perpetuates the oneway cradle to grave manufacturing model dating to the Industrial Revolution that creates such fantastic amounts of waste and pollution in the first place. Why not challenge the belief that human industry must damage the natural world In fact why not take nature itself as our model for making things A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree yet we consider its abundance not wasteful but safe beautiful and highly effective.Waste equals food.Guided by this principle McDonough and Braungart explain how products can be designed from the outset so that after their useful lives they will provide nourishment for something new. They can be conceived as biological nutrients that will easily reenter the water or soil without depositing synthetic materials and toxins. Or they can be technical nutrients that will continually circulate as pure and valuable materials within closedloop industrial cycles rather than being recycled  really downcycled  into lowgrade materials and uses. Drawing on their experience in (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses McDonough and Braungart make an exciting and viable case for putting ecoeffectiveness into practice and show how anyone involved with making anything can begin to do as well.William McDonoughis an architect and the founding principal of William McDonough  Partners Architecture and Community Design based in Charlottesville Virginia. From 1994 to 1999 he served as dean of the school of architecture at the University of Virginia. In 1999 Timemagazine recognized him as a Hero for the Planet stating that his utopianism is grounded in a unified philosophy that  in demonstrable and practical ways  is changing the design of the world. In 1996 he received the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development the highest environmental honor given by the United States.Michael Braungartis a chemist and the founder of the Environmental Protection Encouragement Agency (EPEA) in Hamburg Germany. Prior to starting EPEA he was the director of the chemistry section for Greenpeace. Since 1984 he has been lecturing at universities businesses and institutions around the world on critical new concepts for ecological chemistry and materials flow management. Dr. Braungart is the recipient of numerous honors awards and fellowships from the Heinz Endowment the W.

It explains that products should be designed from the very beginning to be safe for humans and the environment in their assembly use dissassembly and reuse.  The thing I liked most is that the authors believe the solution to our environmental problem is a rethinking of our current methods of production and recycling so that we dont need to give up the technology and standard of living that weve achieved in the 21st century. They dont require us to go back to living in caves or trees in order to save the planet.  I liked this books nowaste vision for the future. The authors propose that all products be composed of materials that allow them at the end of their lives to be either  1) easily dissassembled and efficiently recycled into products of equal quality (not downcycled into lowerquality products like current recycling) or  2) biodegradable so they can be discarded into the environment and do no damage (or better yet enrich the natural environment).  If this vision is achieved thered be no such thing as littering or landfills;William McDonough Michael Braungart

However I found that this allowed Ender to face more complex issues than he had as a boy. Religion especially is featured much more prominently in Speaker and the other 2 books of Enders Saga than in Enders Game.  Still I didnt like this book as much as Enders Game. One of the major reasons I liked Enders Game is because I enjoyed seeing Enders thought process watching him think his way out of problematic situations. Theres not as much of that in Speaker because hes more in control than he was in Enders Game. Also I didnt care about most of the characters not Novinha her family or the other Lusitanians. Ender Jane and to a lesser extent Valentine were the only characters I was really interested in. I found the story overly emotional (theres too much crying) and I wasnt a fan of the Pequeninos (piggies).  Speaker for the Dead is the same type of scifi as Enders Game the technology only plays a supporting role in the story and the focus is actually on the people and the challenges they face in their relationships and religion.  After reading Xenocide (my review) and Children of the Mind (my review) I appreciate Speaker much more. All 3 tell a much more complete story of Ender and the important people in his life than Enders Game alone did. Although Enders Game is still my favorite all the books in Enders Saga complement each other to form an excellent series.  At the end of the audiobook Card explains that Speaker was the real story he wanted to tell and that Enders Game was simply background information. He thought the message of Speaker was more important that when you truly understand someone you can empathize with them no matter how horrible they were and what atrocities they committed. I disagree with that premise and that Speaker is a better story than Enders Game.  The Macmillan Audio audiobook is excellent.;Orson Scott Card

Several plots thicken and theres much more action.  I hated the Path storyline at the beginning but it quickly gets better. I liked the addition of Valentine with her internal analyses and philosophical musings. The part where the humans first go to meet the Hive Queen was disturbing but interesting. The conversations between the Hive Queen and Human about their own natures and human nature add a welcome perspective to the story.  I loved the gradual revelation of Janes origin culminating in a conversation between Ender and the Hive Queen about the philotic connection that the Hive Queen forged with Ender during Enders Game which resulted in Janes creation.  The first time I read this book I didnt like Enders creation of Peter and Valentine in outspace but apparently that part grew on me because I liked it better the second reading. I found Han Qingjao incredibly irritating even more so during the second reading.  Now that Ive read Speaker for the Dead and Children of the Mind I appreciate Xenocide much more.

Even long before man had learned to fly H.G. Wells wrote this story of the Martian attack on England. These unearthly creatures arrive in huge cylinders from which they escape as soon as the metal is cool. The first falls near Woking and is regarded as a curiosity rather than a danger until the Martians climb out of it and kill many of the gaping crowd with a HeatRay. These unearthly creatures have heads four feet in diameter and colossal round bodies and by manipulating two terrifying machines  the Handling Machine and the Fighting Machine  they are as versatile as humans and at the same time insuperable. They cause boundless destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth are powerless against them and it looks as if the end of the World has come. But there is one factor which the Martians in spite of their superior intelligence have not reckoned on. It is this which brings about a miraculous conclusion to this famous work of the imagination.;192;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1320391644m8909.jpg;The War of the Worlds;fiction;This is one of the first scifi books I read in grade school so it made quite an impression. The story is a firsthand account of an Englishmans experiences during a Martian invasion. You really feel the Londoners sense of panic fear and helplessness.  A major theme is that humans the arrogant (and ignorant) dominant species on Earth are humbled by their failure to repel the Martians despite their best military strategies and technologies. I liked the Martians heat rays and tripods and especially the battle with the ship Thunder Child. Every time I read this book I want a modernday rematch  The book is best enjoyed as a product of its time (1898) and forgiven its scientifically inaccurate ideas about biology and space travel. The Martians have evolved to become simply tentacled heads containing massive brains over time theyve lost skeletons and limbs as well as digestive reproductive and immune systems. The book was written before the invention of flight so one must overlook the space transportation being cylinders shot from the surface of Mars.  Given the apocalyptic nature of the story its not surprising that there are a few mentions of religion. At one point the narrator asks a panicked clergyman What good is religion if it collapses under calamity Think of what earthquakes and floods wars and volcanoes have done before to men Did you think God had exempted Weybridge He is not an insurance agent.One of my favorite lines in literature appears at the beginning of this book Yet across the gulf of space...intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our planet with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.

Sun Tzus lessons about war are often applied to business strategy competition marketing and leadership. Among the outdated specific advice and observations about foot soldiers weaponry and terrain Sun Tzu explains several timeless concepts about combat that can apply to business or personal life.  The main theme is to know yourself know your army and know your enemy. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of all parties youll be more likely to make decisions leading to victory. Tzu also recommends using deception whenever possible to confuse the enemy and take them by surprise. He doesnt declare fleeing from battle as cowardly but as a practical alternative to fighting when the odds are against you.  Tzu stresses planning before moving and basing decisions on reason not emotion. He says that the secret to an effective army is to strike a balance between humane treatment and discipline.

952;10883;4;50548;074325807X;Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder from leatheraproned shopkeeper to dining with kings he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacsons vivid and witty fullscale biography we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from historys stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his newfangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours. He was during his 84year life Americas best scientist inventor diplomat writer and business strategist and he was also one of its most practical  though not most profound  political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nations federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America the Albany Plan of Union the Declaration of Independence the treaty of alliance with France the peace treaty with England and the Constitution. And he helped invent Americas unique style of homespun humor democratic values and philosophical pragmatism. But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented and continually reinvented was himself. Americas first great publicist he was in his life and in his writings consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process he carefully crafted his own persona portrayed it in public and polished it for posterity. Through it all he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow leatheraprons more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middleclass values as a source of social strength not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people. Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully and none so intuitively. In this colorful and intimate narrative Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklins amazing life from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman scientist and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklins tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson his practical marriage and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twentyfirst century.;493;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1397772877m10883.jpg;Benjamin Franklin An American Life;history historical fiction biography;This thoroughly researched biography takes a close look at Benjamin Franklins life particularly exploring his personality and beliefs. It starts with his English ancestors follows his parents emigration to America then chronicles his life until his death. I enjoyed reading the stories behind his many maxims. The book provides insight into colonial life before during and after the American Revolution. It highlights Franklins achievements and lasting influence on America.  I had considered myself a Franklin fan and I learned more that I like about him but I also unexpectedly learned even more that soured my view of him. I admire his work ethic frugality innovation selfimprovement entrepreneurship business sense negotiating abilities and rational decisionmaking. However although he was personable and a great networker his relationships were generally shallow and he was a distant and generally unloving husband and father.  I also disagree with Franklins religious views. He abandoned Calvinism for Deism then created his own brand of Deism based on good works. He believed in God but only as a benevolent but distant deity who was best served by helping others. He believed that religion was really only useful for making people behave and improving society and that all religions were valid. He always stressed the material over the spiritual.  Franklins motto could have been Do well by doing good. He showed that one could attract wealth by being in the business of serving others. He said that hed rather live usefully than die rich. He warned against welfare and supported trickledown economics. Franklin retired from business at 42 the midpoint of his life but he arguably accomplished more in the second half. In fact he was 69 at the signing of the Declaration of Independence  Franklin was a master diplomat he knew how to negotiate for mutual benefit which is why he quickly became involved in politics then moved from the local to the international level. He used the Socratic method (nonconfrontational questioning) to influence people. He also said that a secret to being more revered than resented is to be selfdeprecating and unpretentious which he practiced throughout his life.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Benjamin Franklin or the founding of America. I also recommend Franklins autobiography or the modern adaptation (my review).;Walter Isaacson

Lewis finds a common ground on which all those who have Christian faith can stand together proving that at the centre of each there is something or a Someone who against all divergences of belief all differences of temperament all memories of mutual persecution speaks the same voice.;191;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1468102872m11138.jpg;Mere Christianity;nonfiction;C.S. Lewis presents a calm logical defense of the Christian faith. He addresses several common objections to Christianity with rational levelheaded arguments. He doesnt promote any specific denomination his purpose is to introduce mainstream Christianity to atheists and members of other religions.  Lewis says that when you cut through all the doctrinal disagreements the simple purpose of the church is to draw people to Christ. However he does say that doctrine and theology are practical and necessary they serve as the map to our destination (Heaven) its not enough to go by spiritual feelings.  Christianity is commonly accused of being oldfashioned and antiprogressive but Lewis says that becoming a Christian is in fact progressive because its returning back to the path of truthWe all want progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road progress means doing an aboutturn and walking back to the right road in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.A few other points I liked  Choose a church based on the truth of its doctrine not anything superficial like its worship style.  The Devil really exists and acts in our lives.  Jesus must be God or a lunatic he cant simply be a good moral teacher.  A Christian isnt someone who thinks hes doing everything right hes someone who repents and tries to get better each day.  Christians should be so charitable that it hurts they should give until they cant afford everything you want for yourself.  Because hes generally nonconfrontational I was somewhat surprised that Lewis defends the Bibles teachings about homosexuality being forbidden and that the husband is the head of the wife in marriage. Lewis unapologetically admits that these views are unpopular but they are part of Gods law for human relationships. He has an interesting proposal regarding marriage he wishes there were separate definitions of marriage for the church and state so that the Christian rules of marriage dont impinge on those of other faiths just as Christians wouldnt want Islamic marriage rules enforced on them.  I disagree with Lewis (and many other Christians) about the interaction between human free will and Gods sovereignty. Lewis says that we can resist God and prevent our own salvation that free will overpowers Gods will. I believe the Bible teaches that Gods will overcomes all others (see Romans 91318).;C.S. Lewis

If youre religious I recommend this book for understanding the atheist arguments and motivation against religion.  Dawkins lumps all religions together as delusional major religions such as Christianity Judaism and Islam minor faiths such as Mormonism and various tribal religions and even extinct religions such as those of the ancient Greeks. He sees no difference between extremists and moderates. Christians in the United States draw his condescending ire the most.  Dawkins says that religion was an early human invention for coping in a prescientific world. As a Christian I believe that all religions are a perversion of the true religion Christianity (with its Old Testament Jewish roots) which mixed with human myths over millennia. I dont have the time in this review to explain my reasons for believing that only one religion in all history is truly legitimate but an atheist would probably find them preposterous anyway.  Dawkins makes several good points about many illogical defenses of religion and embarrassing attempts to reconcile faith and science. This is warning to Christians that we must be consistent in our beliefs. Many people practice selective faith choosing which parts of the Bible are historical which miracles really occurred and which of Gods commands to obey. It can be difficult to determine in all cases if a text is to be interpreted literally or figuratively but we must try. When Christians treat their faith as a la carte religion atheists understandably smell blood in the water.  The book addresses the roles of religion explanation (how things work) exhortation (morality) consolation (comfort) and inspiration (purpose). According to Dawkins science can fill all these roles eliminating the need for religion. He says theres no evidence or need for a Creator because science reveals the origin of the universe and life. He claims that morality and altruism have no supernatural origins but arose from natural selection and persist because of society and culture.  I disagree with Dawkins that creationists are lazily ignorant and dont research. Admittedly Im a layman but Ive found that creationist organizations like the Institute for Creation Research and Answers in Genesis embrace modern scientific tools and techniques in their studies. Yes they have a different worldview than their secular counterparts but I dont agree that it invalidates their scientific work.  The book contains many interesting statistics such as the inverse relationship between education and intelligence levels and religious beliefs in general the higher a persons education and IQ the lower their selfprofessed level of faith. Also theres no statistical difference in morality between atheists and theists. In the US red or conservative states tend to have higher crime rates than the blue liberal ones. Dawkins admits that there may be additional factors at play and that such relationships may point more to correlation than strict causation.  I liked the books final chapter which includes an interesting discussion of matter and energy the unfathomable scale of the universe from the quantum up to the astronomical.;Richard Dawkins

Lewiss classic vision of the Afterworld the narrator boards a bus on a drizzly English afternoon and embarks on an incredible voyage through Heaven and Hell. He meets a host of supernatural beings far removed from his expectations and comes to some significant realizations about the nature of good and evil.A stunning new edition of this timeless allegory of heaven and hell repackaged and rebranded as part of the C.S. Lewis Signature Classics range.;146;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1166805741m17267.jpg;The Great Divorce;fiction;This fictional story raises thoughtprovoking questions about Heaven Hell and salvation. Lewis insights have inspired me to think and study more about the afterlife. In the preface Lewis makes it clear that this is a fantasy...the transmortal conditions are solely an imaginative supposal they are not even a guess or a speculation at what may actually await us. The last thing I wish is to arouse factual curiosity about the details of the afterworld. Id like to do more research to learn more about Lewis beliefs about the afterlife.  I read this book because I saw many comparing it to Rob Bells Love Wins (read my review). Although there are several points on which I disagree with Lewis I feel closer to his view of Heaven and Hell than to Rob Bells. I differ from both authors in that Im a Calvinist and theyre both Arminian Lewis believes that everyone can be saved but not all choose to be Bell believes that all will be saved despite themselves. Beyond that Ill leave the detailed theological analyses and debates to others.  The narrator (Lewis) begins in The Valley of the Shadow of Death a gloomy town where the residents keep moving further and further away from each other because they cant stand each other. He then travels to The Valley of the Shadow of Life a place on the threshold of Heaven. Chapter 9 provides more backstory. Those in The Valley of the Shadow of Death are allowed to take excursions to The Valley of the Shadow of Life. They can also return to earth to trick mediums haunt houses or spy on people. Those that go to The Valley of the Shadow of Life are allowed to stay if they so choose and eventually graduate or migrate into Heaven.  When Lewis asks is the judgment not final his Teacher replies that to those who leave the town it will not have been Hell but Purgatory. To those who stay in The Valley of the Shadow of Life it will have been Heaven from their first arrival. To those who stay in The Valley of the Shadow of Death it will have been Hell from their first arrival.  The Teacher says that Hell is a state of mind but Heaven is reality itself. When Lewis asks if there can be a choice after death his Teacher replies that he cant understand the relations of choice and Time until hes beyond them.  The Teacher later states There are only two kinds of people in the end those who say to God Thy will be done and those to whom God says in the end Thy will be done. All that are in Hell choose it. Without that selfchoice there could be no Hell. No soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it. Those who seek find. Those who knock it is opened.  In chapter 13 the Teacher (the Spirit who Lewis talks to) says that we cant understand salvation from within Time since its an issue of eternity. He says that neither Predestination (that God eternally saves some and damns others and they have no say in the matter) nor Universalism (that God saves everyone) is correct and that the real relationship between Gods judgment and Mans freedom is more complicated that we can understand.  In the preface Lewis says Earth I think will not be found by anyone to be in the end a very distinct place. I think earth if chosen instead of Heaven will turn out to have been all along only a region in Hell and earth if put second to Heaven to have been from the beginning a part of Heaven itself.  Lewis records the conversations that he has and observes in Heaven. Those arriving in Heaven are called ghosts and the saved who are there are called Spirits. Here are a few memorable conversations  The Big Ghost complains that he hasnt gotten his rights because he went to Hell not Heaven despite his living a good life and the man in Heaven being a murderer. The saved murderer replies that I havent got my rights or I should not be here. You will not get yours either. Youll get something far better. Chapter 4  The Episcopal Ghost complains about being judged for his opinions. He says that honest opinions fearlessly followed are not sins. Dick whos saved replies that their opinions werent honestly come by because they simply followed ideas that seemed modern and successful. He asks When in our whole lives did we honestly face in solitude the one question on which all turned whether after all the Supernatural might not in fact occur Chapter 5  A ghost asks what were born for and a Spirit replies For infinite happiness. Chapter 8  A Spirit explains that no one in Heaven is distinguished but theyre all famous because theyre all known and recognized by God. Chapter 9;C.S. Lewis

As a Tolkien fan I enjoyed learning more about the author his Christianity and his friends in the Inklings. The author spent the summer of 1966 in Tolkiens home critiquing his Silmarillion manuscripts. He made notes of Tolkiens personality behavior and habits. This was published in 1976 before the Silmarillion.  I read this because it was mentioned in A Guide through Narnia by Martha Sammons.  Notes  Summer with Tolkien  As Time went on I discovered [Tolkien] a Barliman Butterbur looking here and there for portion of The Silmarillion.  In point of mystifying circumlocution C.S. Lewis compared Tolkien to his own father whose conversation often contained non sequiturs that first bothered the hearer and then became so outrageous as to be screamingly funny. Tolkiens deviations from the expected were owing not to preoccupation but rather to his scurry after the quarry across mental fences and quagmires.  Numenorean language is based on Hebrew.  One often felt that his words could not pour out fast enough  there was a sense of the galloping on of all his ideas ideas at once along with kaleidoscopic facial changes.  Tolkien liked detective stories and scifi.  His interest in medieval literature and life was more than a profession  it was a love.  Tolkien described Sam Gamgee as vulgar despicable sententious and cocksure.  Tolkien like C.S. Lewis thought an author should first compose a story in poetry then turn it into prose.  Chronology of Composition and Geography of MiddleEarth  Tolkien said MiddleEarth was Northwestern Europe the Shire was England Asia was east of Rhun Africa was south of Harad Numenor was in middle of Atlantic.  Tolkien as Christian Writer  I do not recall a single visit I made to Tolkiens home in which the conversation did not at some point fall easily intoa discussion of religion or rather Christianity.  The Secret Fire was the Holy Spirit.  Tolkien Lewis  Williams  Lewis said of Tolkien The similarities between his work and mine are due I think (a) To nature  Temperament (b) To common sources. We are both soaked in Norse mythology George MacDonalds fairy tales Homer Beowulf and medieval romance. Also of course we are both Christians.;Clyde S. Kilby

Unfortunately I found the fairy tales terribly boring and my mind frequently wandered while I listened to the audiobook.  The only ones I really paid attention to were the familiar stories such as Briar Rose (Sleeping Beauty) The Frog Prince Rapunzel Hansel and Gretel Little RedCap (Little Red Riding Hood) Tom Thumb Rumpelstiltskin and Ashputtel (Cinderella).  My favorite was The Fisherman and his Wife a tale of the consequences of dissatisfaction discontent and hubris. I also liked The Valiant Little Tailor the story of a simple tailor who outwits his stronger and more numerous opponents.  The originals are much more gruesome than the modern childrens versions they frequently feature evil plots dismemberment and death. Each tale has a moral (or several) they tell of the dangers of pride arrogance envy and discontent and the value of honesty and loyalty. Justice is a common theme and good always triumphs over evil.  As youd expect the fairy tales are full of kingdoms heroes witches princes and princesses treasure and talking animals.

The higher up the leadership ladder you go the more vital these skills become often influencing who is hired or fired passed over or promoted. As Goleman shows we all possess the potential to improve our emotional intelligenceat any stage in our career. He provides guidelines for cultivating these capabilitiesand also explains why corporate training must change if it is to be effective.;400;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Working with Emotional Intelligence;nonfiction;Interpersonal skills are especially important in Information Technology because purely technical skills are easily outsourced. Ive become increasingly aware of this since I launched my technology services company OptimWise because although many aspects of IT are based online real business is still mostly done IRL (in real life) where facetoface conversations and other social skills are much more important.  A local entrepreneur recommended this book for its insights into the soft personal skills that become more important as they become rarer in the digital world.  I didnt find a lot of practical information here. I dont disagree with Golemans studies or analysis but I rate nonfiction books based on the measurable value I get out of them and I found his below average. The best nonfiction books are those that leave me with a long todo list of improvements I can start on right away this mostly confirmed that I need to continue developing my social skills. Although I didnt learn anything lifealtering it does present a powerful case for how important interpersonal skills are to success.  According to Goleman  Emotional Intelligence refers to your capacity to recognize your own feelings and those of others for motivating yourself and for managing emotions well in yourself and in your relationships. It describes abilities distinct from but complementary to academic intelligence the purely cognitive capabilities measured by IQ. Many people who are book smart but lack emotional intelligence end up working for people who have lower IQs than they but who excel in emotional intelligence skills.  Why EI is more important than IQ   IQ only accounts for 25 of your career success at most.   Soft skills matter even more in hard (technical) fields than other fields because they make you stand out even more.   Emotional competencies are twice as important as technicalcognitive competencies.   The higher up or more advanced the job the less important technical skills become and the more important the interpersonalemotional skills become.   At the highest levels of leadership 90 of the skills required are emotional.   IQ is genetic and doesnt change much after your teens but EI is learned and can be improved throughout life.   Technical skills can be taught relatively easily in the classroom but emotional skills must be obtained more difficultly through life experiences.  Goleman fills the book with statistical data firsthand reports and dozens of examples of individuals and companies. He also includes several comparisons of people who began with similar skills and backgrounds but one person developed their emotional competencies while the other focused on technical skills. Fastforward a few decades and those who concentrated on the emotional skills were more successful.  Most of the book deals with EI at the individual level but the later chapters talk about organizational intelligence. He suggests ways to train employees by focusing on honesty openness communication and teamwork. Rather than each individual trying to be a star they should instead help everyone else be a star.  The 5 basic emotional and social competencies  Selfawareness Knowing what we are feeling in the moment and using those preferences to guide our decision making having a realistic assessment of our own abilities and a well grounded sense of self confidence.  Selfregulation Having control over our emotions so that they facilitate rather then interfere with the task in hand being conscientious and delaying gratification to pursue goals recovering well from emotional distress.  Motivation Using our deepest preferences to move and guide us towards our goals to help us take initiative and strive to improve and to persevere in the face of setbacks and frustrations.  Empathy Sensing what people are feeling being able to take their perspective and cultivating rapport and attunement with a broad diversity of people.  Social skills Handling emotions in relationships well and accurately reading social situations and networks interacting smoothly using these skills to persuade and lead negotiate and settle disputes for cooperation and teamwork.  Notes  Take time out to do nothing and reflect on your values and passions.  Having skills isnt enough you must believe in them to promote yourself.  Train yourself to withstand amygdala hijacks when your brain responds to an emotional event by going into crisis mode which halts complex thought and triggers kneejerk responses.  Balance the competencies. For example too much selfcontrol limits innovation.  The most rewarding parts of work are the creative challenge and stimulation and the chance to keep learning.  Find your flow the state of mind where youre so engaged that you get lost in your work enjoy the challenge do your best work and have fun.  Set your goals so high that you only hit 50 of them.  Declarative knowledge (knowing a concept and its technical details) isnt as valuable as procedural knowledge (being able to put the concept and details into action).;Daniel Goleman

Cialdini explains six weapons of influence showing how theyre used why they work and how to resist them. Theres plenty of research and anecdotes. The lessons are applied to everyday life and frequently to marketing and sales.  The main point is that when we focus on a single influencing feature rather than the entire situation we often respond automatically leading to a poor decision. Although influencing features can provide shortcuts that save us time in analyzing a situation we must be wary of those people who misrepresent evidence and use their influence to exploit.  The six principles of influence are reciprocation commitment and consistency social proof liking authority and scarcity.  Several of the anecdotes are longwinded.  Ive seen this book on many lists of business books and finally decided to read it because Daniel Pink recommended it in To Sell is Human.  Notes  Reciprocation  Present the customer the more expensive item first so subsequent items seem relatively inexpensive.  People tend to reciprocate concessions. To apply this offer an expensive option when they decline offer a less expensive option. As another example ask for a big favor when they decline ask for a small favor.  Commitment and Consistency  The footinthedoor technique ask a person to make a small commitment which manipulates their selfimage. Later theyll be more likely to comply with more and larger requests that are consistent with this image. Written commitments are especially effective.  To get a child to behave longterm its more effective to provide a reason they can internalize and take personal responsibility for than to make external threats.  To test a decision youve made (or are about to make) ask yourself Knowing what I know now would I make the same choice  Social Proof  If you need medical help in a crowd the most effective option is to be precise about your need for aid. Pick one person point to them and say You sir in the blue jacket I need help. Call an ambulance.  We will use the actions of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves especially when we view those others as similar to ourselves.  Liking  People tend to like those who are similar in interests background interest age religion and politics.  Continued exposure to a person or object under unpleasant conditions such as frustration conflict or competition leads to less liking.  Cooperation towards common goals is one of the best ways to overcome hostility between different groups.  People become fonder of people and things the experience while eating. Thats why food is often served when people are trying to influence.  Authority  People tend not to question the orders of those they perceive to be legitimate authorities.  A persons title clothes and trappings (status symbols) affect their perceived authority.  Scarcity  Parental interference make some couples feel greater love and desire for marriage.;Robert B.

966;29031;5;50548;0849917735;Contrary to popular belief we do not have to be perfect to do Gods work. Look no further than the twelve disciples whose many weaknesses are forever preserved throughout the pages of the New Testament. Jesus chose ordinary men  fisherman tax collectors political zealots  and turned their weakness into strength producing greatness from utter uselessness. MacArthur draws principles from Christs careful handson training of the original twelve disciples for todays modern disciple  you.;224;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Twelve Ordinary Men;nonfiction;An enlightening look at Jesus twelve disciples drawing out lessons that can be applied to any ordinary Christian. It starts by looking at the disciples as a group then delves into each disciple individually discussing their personalities and actions.  The book drives home how ordinary the disciples were yet how God used them for such great good. It shows how God can use our imperfect efforts too. The book mentions several times Jesus foreknowledge and predestination of all things that occurred in His life and in all of history. It also points out prophecies that foretold events in Jesus life.  Its informative and interesting I learned several facts and considered new concepts. Author John MacArthur is a conservative evangelical who believes that Jesus is God and that the Bible is inspired and infallible. The book is packed with supporting verses.  There were a few times where I thought the author read too much into the text or went too far in his assumptions about the disciples lives thoughts and attitudes. But I dont feel that it detracted greatly.  Disciples in general  Disciples means learners students. Apostles means messengers sent ones.  Not one of the men he chose came from the religious establishment. The choosing of the twelve apostles was a judgment against institutionalized Judaism.  It was not because they had extraordinary talents unusual intellectual abilities powerful political influence or some special social status. They turned the world upside down because God worked in them to do it. God chooses the humble the lowly the meek and the weak so that theres never any question about the source of power when their lives change the world.  What did Jesus mean when he said in Mark 91 that there some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God The answer is in the next verse the transfiguration which happened 6 days later.  It appears that all the apostles with the exception of Judas Iscariot were to some degree already true seekers after divine truth before they met Jesus. They were already being drawn by the Spirit of God.  [The apostles] shortcomings and weaknesses show up more often than their strengths. Even the acts that are recorded highlight their imperfections (Mark 91429). The Gospel doesnt portray them as heroes until after Jesus ascended and the Holy Spirit empowered them. Even then the biblical record is sparse. The legacy of their true greatness is the church.  Jesus  Instead of taking the populist route and exploiting His fame [Jesus] began to emphasize the very things that made His message so controversial. At about the time the crowds reached their peak He preached a message so boldly confrontive and so offensive in its content that the multitude melted away leaving only the most devoted few (John 66667).  In Matt 2652 Jesus affirmed the equity of capital punishment as a divine law.  The feeding of the 5000 showed that Christ can use so little to accomplish so much. No gift is really insignificant in His hands. He could have created food from nothing but the way he fed the crowd illustrates how God works. He takes the sacrificial and often insignificant gifts of people who give faithfully and He multiplies them to accomplish monumental things.  Peter  Rather than criticizing Peter for his lack of faith when walking on water give him credit for having the faith to leave the boat in the first place. Also although he denied Christ only he and one other disciple followed Jesus to the high priests house (John 185).  Thomas   Dont be too hard on Thomas. The other disciples didnt believe in the resurrection until they saw Jesus either (Mark 161011 13 John 2020).   Thomas made what was probably the greatest statement ever to come from the lips of the apostles My Lord and my God [John 2028] Let those who question the deity of Christ meet Thomas.  Simon the Zealot  Simon was a Zealot a group who worked to overthrow Roman occupation through terrorism and violence. Simon had to associate with Matthew who was at the opposite end of the political spectrum collecting taxes for the Roman government.  Truth and love  Zeal for the truth must be balanced by love for people. Truth without love has no decency its just brutality. On the other hand love without truth has no character its just hypocrisy. Many people are just as an unbalanced...only in the other direction. They place too much emphasis on the love side of the fulcrum... In each case truth is missing and all they are left with his error clothed in a shallow tolerant sentimentality. It is a poor substitute for genuine love. They talk a lot about love and tolerance but they utterly lack any concern for the the truth. Therefore even the love they speak of is a tainted love. Real love does not rejoice in iniquity but rejoices in the truth. (1 Corinthians 136).  Gods sovereignty and human choice  Charles Spurgeon in his sermon Sovereign Grace and Mans Responsibility said  That God predestines and that man is responsible are two things that few can see. They are believed to be inconsistent and contradictory but they are not. It is just the fault of our weak judgment. Two truths cannot be contradictory to each other. If then I find taught in one place that everything is foreordained that is true and if I find in another place that man is responsible for all his actions that is true and it is my folly that leads me to imagine that two truths can ever contradict each other. These two truths I do not believe can ever be welded into one upon any human anvil but one they shall be in eternity they are two lines that are so nearly parallel that the mind that shall pursue them farthest will never discover that they converge but they do converge and they will meet somewhere in eternity close to the throne of God whence all truth doth spring.;John F.

968;29797;2;50548;0486426750;This famous story of mans progress through life in search of salvation remains one of the most entertaining allegories of faith ever written. Set against realistic backdrops of town and country the powerful drama of the pilgrims trials and temptations follows him in his harrowing journey to the Celestial City.Along a road filled with monsters and spiritual terrors Christian confronts such emblematic characters as Worldly Wiseman Giant Despair Talkative Ignorance and the demons of the Valley of the Shadow of Death. But he is also joined by Hopeful and Faithful.An enormously influential 17thcentury classic universally known for its simplicity vigor and beauty of language The Pilgrims Progressremains one of the most widely read books in the English language.;324;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1405982367m29797.jpg;The Pilgrims Progress;fiction;This book was written in England in the 1600s and you can tell. The archaic language sounds odd to a modern American reader. If you do read it it will be for the content not the style.  The book contains two stories the first is about a man named Christian who is convicted of his sin after reading a book (the Bible) and departs his family and hometown the City of Destruction (a life of sin) to make for the Celestial City (Heaven). On his way he encounters allies such as Faithful and Hopeful but also enemies like Apollyon (Satan).  The second story tells of Christians wife Christiana and her children becoming pilgrims (Christians) as well and leaving the City of Destruction. They meet some of the same obstacles and people as Christian but for the most part the characters and events of this story are different than the first.  The Christian life is compared to a pilgrimage because this earthly material world isnt our home were simply traveling through it on the way to Heaven. Both stories show that the Christian life is usually characterized by suffering and persecution. but that all suffering ends immediately upon entrance to Heaven. The author certainly wouldnt agree with the popular prosperity (health and wealth) gospel.  The characters often speak lines straight out of the King James Version of the Bible and the names of the people and places make it pretty obvious what they stand for. Figuring out the symbolism in this allegory isnt very challenging.;John Bunyan

The story was unfulfilling. Theres too much overly emotional dialog crying and arguing especially involving the annoying Novinha and Quara. The story does wrap up several loose ends contains Cards usual philosophical musings and emphasizes the importance of relationships and love.  Children of the Mind concludes the story that started in Speaker for the Dead (my review) and continued in Xenocide (my review). Together the three tell a more complete story of Ender and the important people in his life than Enders Game (my review) alone did. Although Enders Game is still my favorite all the books in Enders Saga complement each other to form an excellent series.  I found the parts with Malu the Samoan holy man to be bizarre. How does he know so much about Jane He seems to have psychic insights. I also wanted to know more about the Descoladores. The characters hypothesize about their culture and communication but Card doesnt resolve this mystery.  Quotes  Everyone dies. Everyone leaves. What matters is the things you build together before they go.  Changing the world is good for those who want their names in books. But being happy that is for those who write their names in the lives of others and hold the hearts of others as the treasure most dear.;Orson Scott Card
971;31837;3;50548;0140447806;Boethius was an eminent public figure under the Gothic emperor Theodoric and an exceptional Greek scholar. When he became involved in a conspiracy and was imprisoned in Pavia it was to the Greek philosophers that he turned. THE CONSOLATION was written in the period leading up to his brutal execution. It is a dialogue of alternating prose and verse between the ailing prisoner and his nurse Philosophy. Her instruction on the nature of fortune and happiness good and evil fate and free will restore his health and bring him to enlightenment. THE CONSOLATION was extremely popular throughout medieval Europe and his ideas were influential on the thought of Chaucer and Dante.;192;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1477580108m31837.jpg;The Consolation of Philosophy;nonfiction;In this work from 524 AD Lady Philosophy (philosophy personified) leads the imprisoned author Boethius through discussions about fortune happiness justice predestination and free will. Through logical reasoning they make deductions that build throughout their conversation. They often refer to the philosophies of Socrates Plato and Aristotle. Lady Philosophy and Boethius believe in a monotheistic God similar to that of Christianity although theres no explicit mention of Christianity.  There are a few main themes. One is that happiness doesnt come from wealth power dignity fame or material pleasures in fact it comes from independence from material things but ultimately from God its true source. Another theme is that God knows and controls everything but that this doesnt impinge on mans free will.  I read this because The Tolkien Professor podcast recommended it for its treatment of the doctrine of predestination and free will which Ive never felt Ive quite understood. This book made things a little clearer but it remains a nebulous concept.  I listened to the free LibriVox audibook based on the translation by H.R. James.  Gods nature  The world isnt governed by random hazard but God the creator rationally governs his work.  All things proceed from God.  Human nature  Humans have a spark of true knowledge from God but they can forget it.  Humans are insatiably covetous.  People are naturally good. Those who are too weak to be good are evil. All men seek good but some fail to achieve it because of their perversion.  Fortune and material possessions  Humans are never content they always have something theyre discontented about. The better a mans fortune the more sensitive he is to misfortune.  All passes neither good fortune nor material things last.  The more possessions a man has the more care they require they end up owning him. A man with fewer possessions is free of the worry they involve.  Theres no such thing as misfortune. All fortunes are either just (such as punishment for evil) or useful (such as the correction of bad behavior).  Happiness  Happiness doesnt come from wealth power dignity fame or pleasures. It comes from independence especially from material things.  All men are pursuing happiness.  Happiness doesnt depend on fortune or material possessions.  God is the source of highest good and happiness.  Justice  We misinterpret the good as suffering and the evil as being rewarded but the good are always favored and evil always punished.  Predestination and free will  God guides all events in his providence. Humans cant fully understand His plans.  Free will exists despite Gods foreknowledge and providence even though humans cant understand the apparent paradox.  God is eternal and lives in an eternal present theres no past or future. Because Hes outside of time the timedependent concept of foreknowledge doesnt actually make sense.  A paraphrase of the discussion of free will from Book 5 Song 5  Compare two events the sun rising and a man walking. At the moment of their occurrence they must be taking place yet the suns rising before it took place was necessarily obliged to be while the mans walking wasnt. The things which to God are present exist without doubt. But some come from the necessity of things and others from the power of the agent. From the standpoint of the divine knowledge all things take place of necessity but considered of themselves from a human standpoint theyre free of necessity.  So if its in a mans power to change his purpose does that make providence void since you could change something God foreknows You can change your purpose but providence is inescapable just as its impossible to escape a present spectator. Gods everpresent comprehension and survey of all things comes not from his seeing future events but from his very nature. So mans will exists despite providence and foreknowledge and humans are still responsible for their own actions.;Boethius Victor Watts

They emphasize nonverbal communication such as body language and vocal tone. This book definitely increased my awareness of my social behavior and Ill keep several of the tips in mind.  If youve read How to Win Friends and Influence People (my review) or other books about winning people over you wont find much new here. However there are a few tips that countered common wisdom such as waiting until after a caller announces their name to sound excited (rather than sounding excited as soon as you answer). Some tips seem disingenuous and manipulative such as timing your smile crafting your compliments and altering your behavior but most are sound.  I listened to the audiobook which is energetically read by the author. She comes across as overconfident but shes also funny at times. The 3.5hour recording contains 62 tips instead of the books 92.  By the way besides How to Win Friends I highly recommend Never Eat Alone (my review).  My favorite tips   When introduced to someone pivot 100 towards them.   When asked what you do give an explanation along with your job title.   Listen for the other person to drop clues about their interests then ask about them.   Keep turning the spotlight of conversation on the other person.   Parrot the other persons last few words in the form of a question to keep the conversation going.   Ask How do you spend most of your time not What do you do   Mimic the motions and manners of the other person.   Mimic the words and phrases of the other person.   Use the words we us and our to imply camaraderie.   The killer compliment privately and sincerely compliment the other person on a specific attractive quality or trait. Dont do this more than twice a year per person or youll dilute its effect.   On the phone replace gestures with words.   On the phone use a persons name much more often than when facetoface.;Leil Lowndes

I would have thought with all the hype surrounding this final episode of Star Wars that theyd have found a better author. Ive seen the movie a few times but even so I didnt find this book at all engaging. I felt little motivation to keep reading it. I did finish it just because it does have some additional information and explanation beyond whats in the movie.  The first onethird of the book follows Anakin and ObiWan aboard General Grevious ship The Invisible Hand. The battle over Coruscant takes only a few minutes in the movie but the book dedicates about 150 of its total 400 pages to it It definitely wasnt time well spent because I just kept wishing that the story would move along.  The book contains much more dialog than the movie which was pretty actionfocused. Like all the Star Wars novelizations theres more exploration of the characters hopes fears and intentions. Discussions of the Jedi Council are recorded including discussions between Mace Windu and Yoda. The first seeds of the Rebellion are sown by Bail Organa Mon Mothma and Padme Amidala. There are many conversations between Anakin Skywalker and Chancellor PalpatineDarth Sidious in which Sidious tempts Anakin to join the Dark Side. Near the end QuiGon Jinn converses with Yoda through the Force and offers to teach him the secret to maintaining consciousness in the Force after death.  Only recommended for Star Wars fans.;Matthew Woodring Stover George Lucas

Never again will you think about thinking the same way.Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now in Blink he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking about choices that seem to be made in an instant  in the blink of an eye  that actually arent as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers while others are consistently inept Why do some people follow their instincts and win while others end up stumbling into error How do our brains really work  in the office in the classroom in the kitchen and in the bedroom And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to othersIn Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last based on a few minutes of observing a couple the tennis coach who knows when a player will doublefault before the racket even makes contact with the ball the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here too are great failures of blink the election of Warren Harding New Coke and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers arent those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating but those who have perfected the art of thinslicing  filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.Drawing on cuttingedge neuroscience and psychology and displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic Blink changes the way you understand every decision you make.

He tells of the surprising accuracy of snap judgments and how peoples experiences greatly influence their decisions despite their unawareness. Many of his stories are fascinating but his slow winding way of telling them is frustrating. I wanted to shout I get the point Move on I didnt like this book as much as Outliers (read my review) but I wasnt as interested in this topic as the subject of Outliers (achieving success).  I really liked the investigation into how ignorant people are of the factors that affect their decisions. One of my favorite sections was about how people perceive food to taste better or worse based on the foods branding and packaging. Gladwell also shows that counterintuitively too much information or too many choices inhibit judgements because they become distracting. This idea is also explored in Nudge (read my review) which I highly recommend.  I had heard of this book before but finally decided to read it after Brendon Sinclair recommended it in the The Web Design Business Kit 2.0 from SitePoint. In the kit Brendon explains that web designers need to design websites that make great first impressions and are simple enough to facilitate quick unconscious decisions. Ill try to keep these lessons in mind for my web design company OptimWise.  Gladwell shows that snap judgments can be quite accurate because of thin slicing the brain is able to get a read on a person or object based on a very short exposure to them. Of first impressions he says that sometimes we can know more about someone or something in the blink of an eye than after months of study.  We make judgments based on our experiences and situations so prejudice and stereotypes can lead us astray. To minimize their effects Gladwell suggests that we change our experiences. For example by spending more time with the people against whom were prejudiced we can retrain our brains to overcome the prejudice.;Malcolm Gladwell
976;40745;4;50548;1400062756;Now updated with new research  the book that has changed millions of lives.After decades of research worldrenowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck Ph.D. discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea the power of mindset. In this brilliant book she shows how success in school work sports the arts and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset those who believe that abilities are fixed  are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents teachers managers and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.In this edition Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset you can motivate those you lead teach and love  to transform their lives and your own.;276;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Mindset The New Psychology of Success;nonfiction;This book changed my perspective on abilities and potential. Dweck shows how to move from the fixed mindset (the belief that human qualities and abilities are set and essentially unalterable) to the growth mindset (the belief that those qualities and abilities can be cultivated through effort). Dweck a psychologist based the book on solid scientific research not the pseudoscientific mystical nonsense often found in success psychology books. Dweck applies the mindsets to sports business leadership relationships parenting and teaching. The book has far too many anecdotes for my taste its full of specific examples of famous CEOs and athletes as well as ordinary people.  My favorite parts were those that advised how to talk to children about their successes and failures. Intellectually I agree with Dwecks advice that you should praise effort not ability and that when a child does something quickly you should challenge rather than praise them but that can be emotionally difficult for a parent to do. I also found the section on bullying interesting because I was bullied for most of my school years. I skimmed the many examples from sports because Im generally disinterested in sports.  I read this because it was referred to in several books articles and podcasts about business andor web design.  The Mindsets  Fixed Mindset   Your qualities and intelligence are very basic to you and cant change very much. If you have the ability youll do well. If you dont you wont.   Characteristics passing up chances to learn feeling labeled by a failure getting discouraged when something requires effort.   Framework judge and be judged You have permanent traits and Im judging them.  Growth Mindset   No matter your qualities and intelligence you can always change substantially. Abilities can be cultivated and improved.   Characteristics taking challenges learning from failure continuing effort.   Framework learn and help learn You are a developing person and I am interested in your development.  The Truth About Ability and Accomplishment   In the growth mindset abilities can be cultivated but that doesnt mean that everything can or should be changed.   Benjamin Bloom after 40 years of research on school learning said What any person in the world can learn almost all persons can learn if provided with the appropriate prior and current conditions of learning.   Just because some people can do something with little or no training it doesnt mean that others cant do it (and sometimes do it even better) with training.   People (especially children) do better when praised for effort than ability.  Relationships Mindsets in Love (Or Not)   The fixed mindset believes that successful relationships dont require effort. The growth mindset believes that they do.  Bullying   To reduce bullying change the school mindset.   Fight the atmosphere of judgement and create one of collaboration and selfimprovement.   Empower bystanders to help victims.   Enforce discipline but dont judge the bully as a person. Make them feel liked and welcomed at school.   Praise the bullys steps in the right direction (staying out of fighting getting along with others). Praise efforts not the person.   Teachers can point a bully away from judgment and towards compassion by not implying theyre a bad person showing respect and asking for the bullys advice for helping bullied students.  Parents Teachers and Coaches Where Do Mindsets Come From   Give children the growthmindset message You are a developing person and I am interested in your development not the fixedmindset message You have permanent traits and Im judging them.   Praising childrens intelligence harms motivation and performance. It gives a temporary boost but if they run into difficulty theyll think failure means theyre dumb. Instead praise for the growthoriented process what they accomplish through practice study persistence strategy.   Dont talk about others in terms of fixed judgments in front of children or theyll think you use the same fixed judgments on them.   When children do something quickly and perfectly dont praise their speed and perfection. Instead say it was too easy and give them a challenge.   When a child fails tell them you understand their disappointment but theyll need to work harder.   Use misbehavior as an occasion for teaching not judgment.   When teachers judge students will sabotage the teacher by not trying. When teachers care for students and show them school is a way to grow their minds they try.

It probably didnt help my expectations that Ive been told this is one of the great scifi classics. So I was somewhat underwhelmed to find that this book is actually a collection of mildly interesting short stories.  The book was published in 1950 but the stories take place from 1996 to 2064. Playing a role in most of the stories is Susan Calvin a robopsychologist whos often called upon to explain robot behavior in the light of the 3 Laws of Robotics  1. A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm.  2. A robot must obey any orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  As time progresses between each story the robots become increasingly advanced they begin as mute mechanical workers handling menial tasks and eventually take the form of robotic Machines that control the sociological and economic forces of the 4 Regions of planet Earth. Along the way humanity is confronted with issues of morality ethics and sentience that arise when humans and robots share space.  The stories are somewhat entertaining and intellectual. Theres usually some mysterious robotic behavior that needs to be corrected which requires humans to logically analyze how the Laws of Robotics are being obeyed to unexpected ends.  The book contains a lot of classic science fiction fare sentient machines mindreading planetary colonies and interstellar travel. The stories are fairly interesting but I dont think its deserving of its high reputation in the scifi genre.;Isaac Asimov

Its examples include text in a variety of languagesincluding English Russian German and Greekwhich is particularly helpful if your work has a multinational focus.;0;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Elements of Typographic Style;nonfiction;This book contains more than Ive ever wanted to know about typography. It describes not only how to use fonts but also how to create them explaining the math and science involved in font design. It also describes techniques for laying out text on pages. It reveals the history of typography from the days of clay and early paper to the invention of the printing press to modern digital typography. Bringhurst has a relaxing elegant writing style thats a pleasure to read.  I wanted to read a typography book because Im using Web fonts more frequently in the websites I create in my web design business OptimWise. I chose this book because it was on the reading list of notable graphic designer Jason Santa Maria. Ill admit that I skimmed large sections of the book that arent relevant to my work including details on creating font faces and the second half of the book which contains font face specimens and appendices.  Bringhurst makes several thoughtprovoking statements about typography. I liked these   ...typography must often draw attention to itself before it will be read. Yet in order to be read it must relinquish the attention it has drawn.   Typography should invite the reader into the text and reveal the tenor and meaning of the text.   Consult the ancestors. Typography is an ancient craft an an old profession as well as a constant technological frontier.   ...typography itself has not improved. There is no greater proof that typography is more art than engineering. Like all the arts it is basically immune to progress though it is not immune to change.  Rhythm  Proportion   Single columns should contain 4575 characters (66 are ideal). Multiple columns should contain 4050 characters.   ...avoid consecutive hyphenated lineends but frequent hyphens are better than sloppy spacing and ragged setting is better yet.   Use a single space after periods and other punctuation dont doublespace.   Add little or no space within strings of initials such as J.P. Morgan.   In numbered lists dont put too much space between numbers and text.   Dont begin or end a page with isolated lines use at least two lines from a paragraph.  Harmony  Counterpoint   Use bold weights sparingly.   Text weight should decrease as size increases.  Structural Forms  Devices  Titles should be spaced caps the same size and weight as body text. If using a large size for titles use an upper and lowercase titling font or lightened version of the body font.  Analphabetic Symbols   Use the dimension sign instead of the letter x for dimensions.   Use closeset en dashes to indicate a range such as 56 PM or 2530 minutes. In prose use the word to instead.   Dont use periods in acronyms and abbreviations written with small caps like AM PM Washington DC.  Choosing  Combining Type   Choose faces that suit the task as well as the subject. Choose 1) an inherently good type 2) a good type for the medium and how it will be read and 3) a type thats sympathetic to the theme of the content.   Choose faces whose individual spirit and character is in keeping with the text.   Start with a single typographic family. For example pair serifs and sans serifs from the same family. However feel free to expand beyond that family mixing and matching.   Pair serifed and unserifed faces on the basis of their inner structure. When the basic text is set in a serifed face a related sanserif is frequently used for other elements...  Shaping the Page  To invite continuous reading use columns that are taller than they are wide.  The State of the Art  Good text faces for the screen are therefore as a rule faces with low contrast a large torso open counters sturdy terminals and slab serifs or no serifs at all.;Robert Bringhurst
979;49113;2;50548;084238104X;In Finding God in the Land of Narnia  bestselling authors Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware explore the deep spiritual themes of redemption and grace found in the popular Chronicles of Narnia series by C. S. Lewis. With amazing clarity that captures the tone and style of C. S. Lewis himself the authors offer a depth of insight that will surprise even the most ardent Lewis fan. Each chapter will help readers gain not only a deeper understanding of the popular Lewis series but a deeper understanding of God himself.;184;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1399868296m49113.jpg;Finding God in the Land of Narnia;nonfiction;This wasnt as enlightening as Id hoped. The lessons are fairly shallow and the connections pretty obvious. I was hoping for something deeper and was disappointed as I was with Finding God in the Lord of the Rings. It contains only a small sampling of the biblical truths in Narnia the authors missed many opportunities. Even the ones they chose dont seem to be the strongest examples. Its more of a devotional than a book for study.  It covers all 7 Narnia books but has only 3 or 4 short chapters from each. Each chapter is 23 pages of paraphrase from a book then 34 pages of a biblical lesson that can be drawn from that section. It has plenty of verses.  Notes  Remnant theology  Remnant theology (the truth that the true people of God have always been a small and faithful remnant surrounded by a large unbelieving majority) appears throughout the Bible. Examples Abrahams call the Exodus the wilderness wanderings the divided kingdom the Exile the restoration Jesus tiny following of average people and the scattered New Testament church (1 Peter 11). Other verses which speak of it Deut 265 1 Chron 1619 Matt 714 Is 1022.In view of all this should believers ever be surprised to find themselves in the minority Hardly. ... Would David be shaken Would Elijah be shocked Would Jesus be caught off guard ... they would probably take a look around shrug their shoulders and say Appears to be situation normal. Now lets get back to work.This is Scriptures most recurrent portrait of the true church a fellowship of unlikely heroes who overcome the enemy not in strength of numbers or by dint of force but by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and by not loving their lives unto death (Rev 1211).The albatross in Dawn Treader  There is a long literary tradition of Christian symbolism associated with the albatross. Seafaring men regarded it as a messenger from God. Its appearance in the sky was always interpreted as an omen of great good. The albatross has Christian symbolism in Moby Dick and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  Aslans Table in Dawn Treader  Aslans Table in Dawn Treader represents Communion (Lords Supper).;Kurt Bruner Jim Ware

Wade have on violent crime These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple unasked question. Some of these questions concern lifeanddeath issues others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight Levitt and coauthor Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is at root the study of incentives how people get what they want or need especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about realestate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world despite a surfeit of obfuscation complication and downright deceit is not impenetrable is not unknowable and if the right questions are asked is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt through devilishly clever and cleareyed thinking shows how to seethrough all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise If morality represents how we would like the world to work then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.;207;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Freakonomics A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything;nonfiction;I liked this book more for its premise than its content. That premise is that the answers to trivial and profound questions can be found through statistics. Or as the book sleeve states If morality represents how we would like the world to work then economics represents how it actually does work.  The book does a good job explaining the difference between correlation and causality and gives a basic explanation of regression analysis. I like how the authors present their findings as unbiased facts whether theyre politically correct or not.  The book gives specific examples of questions that the authors have asked and found the answers to including incentives and cheating in teaching and sumo wrestling the power of information in the KKK and realty the mythology of conventional wisdom in drug dealing and prostitution the true causes of increasing and decreasing crime the effect parents have on their children and the effect a childs name has on the childs life.  The book is full of eyeopening information gleaned from countless studies. It explains why a real estate agent isnt truly motivated to get the highest price possible when selling a house because the marginal profit to herself is too small an incentive. It explains that abortion has caused a drop in the crime rate because it prevented the births of thousands of children who are statistically likely to commit crimes based on their parents conditions but that the number of aborted fetuses far outweighs the predicted number of prevented deaths.  Two chapters of the book are devoted to parenting. The first describes factors that influence a childs success and shows that who parents are (their education success and health) affects their childrens success but what the parents do (working spanking reading to the child) does not. The second chapter on parenting shows the effect that a childs name has on the opportunities that child will have in life because whether consciously or subconsciously people make judgments based on names.  Overall the book was interesting enough to make reading it worthwhile but it probably doesnt deserve a second read.;Steven D. Levitt Stephen J. Dubner

It would be far more convincing if the examples were of real companies and people rather than fictional ones. As a fictional story its too dismiss as a tall tale.  The fictional companies all provide aboveandbeyond service such as a full service gas station that charges the same as the selfserve station across the street. The protagonist at one point wonders how these businesses afford to offer such extravagance but this question isnt addressed in the book. It seems overly simple to say they earn it back by having raving fans.  I read this because Im working on making customer service at my website maintenance company OptimWise even better.  Summary  Have a vision of your own. Then talk to customers. Listen to them even to their silence. Know when to implement and when to ignore what customers want. Take this vision and turn it into an action plan. Be consistent improve on an ongoing basis and alter course quickly. Promise more only up to the point you can deliver consistently and then deliver more increasing by 1 at a time.  Notes  Secret 1 Decide What You Want  Have a vision for the business you want to build.  Meet customer needs whenever possible even if it means sending them to a competitor. Encourage employees to use their own initiative to meet customer needs.  Help customers save money and time.  Educate customers about your products so they can make better decisions.  Make it easy for customers to get help.  Dont be afraid to be unconventional. Businesslike businesses ... arent necessarily famous for customer service.  Create a vision of perfection centered on the customer.  Compare vision to your organizations reality to see what needs work.  Secret 2 Discover What the Customer Wants  Discover customers vision of what they really want then alter your vision if needed.  Everyone touched by your product is your customer from original purchase agent to end user. Discover what they all want which is best done by asking them but watch for 3 traps  1. Customer says one thing and means another.  2. Customer is silent. That may indicate a problem.  3. Customer says your service is fine. That may indicate a problem.  Listen to the music as well as the lyrics. Pay attention to what customer isnt saying.  Realize that fine or silence is a message and ask sincere questions to find what theyre not saying.  As you uncover customers vision one bit at a time work it into your vision or reject it.  Tie raises and promotions to scores employees receive from their customers (internal and external). Thank and reward employees for looking after customers so they keep doing it.  Secret 3 Deliver Plus One  Deliver the Vision Plus One Percent. Deliver consistently. Improve by 1 repeatedly based on customer needs.  Exceeding expectations is important but its even more important to consistently meet expectations.;Kenneth H. Blanchard Sheldon Bowles Harvey MacKay

There are plenty of actionpacked scenes that quicken the storys pace.  This book takes place after Enders Game and Enders Shadow when the kids from Battle School have returned to Earth. Now that the threat of the Buggers is gone the nations have begun vying for political and military supremacy exploiting the young geniuses from the Battle School. Several of the kids appear throughout the book but it mainly follows Bean and Petra as they interact with Peter Wiggin and Achilles.  I really liked learning about Peter Wiggin. Hes mentioned throughout the Ender books but his character is only developed enough to fill his role as Enders brother and he seemed supernaturally powerful in his political manipulations. In this book Peter is a teenager struggling with his role as the anonymous Locke desperately trying to figure out how to return political stability to Earth.  Another part I liked was when Bean meets Mrs. Wiggin Ender and Peters mother. Shes honest with Bean about how much she knows about her children and how she feels about them. This was a welcome change from the other books where you hardly know the Wiggin parents.  This book is a mustread for fans of Enders Game and the other Ender books;Orson Scott Card

Martins A Song of Ice and Fire series the more I like it. It helps that Im becoming more familiar with the people places and history. This books title is apt because it contains so much fighting including handtohand combat and fullscale battles. Its more violent and bloody than the first two books.  The pace quickens and the plot thickens in this book. Besides an increase in violence theres more magic and hints at deeper mysteries. Theres also more political manipulation there are betrayals alliances forged and destroyed and several puppeteers pulling strings. You never know whos really in control. Martin isnt afraid to injure or kill prominent characters which keeps you guessing. Many chapters end with cliffhangers.  This series is one of gritty realism its not clean romantic fantasy like Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings or Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia. Martins books feature gore profanity and sex.  In this book I liked reading about the training regimen and ethos of the Unsullied. Tyrions and Jon Snows stories were my favorites Jaimes and Catelyns were my least.

984;65439;4;50548;1857922018;Are we missing out on blessings from God by ignoring the Lords Day Joey Pipa investigates and presents his conclusions it could change the way you think about Sunday;239;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Lords Day;nonfiction;A biblical defense of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath. Pipa explains the biblical basis for Sabbathkeeping and gives practical advice on doing it. Pipa holds the view of the Lords Day expressed in the Westminster Confession of Faith (21.7  21.8) and he quotes from that confession and from the Westminster Larger Catechism (Q. 115121).  The explanation of the difference between a moral law and a moralpositive law was helpful.  Pipa briefly answers some objections to the views that Christians must keep the Sabbath and that the Sabbath was changed to Sunday but I wish he spent more time on such objections.  SummaryAt creation God established the moral obligation of keeping holy one day in seven and He reiterated this obligation in the Ten Commandments along with all the other great moral principles ... The particular day however was not part of the moral requirement of the law but a positive law to regulate the fulfilling of the moral responsibility. Thus the day of the week could be changed. The New Testament repeals the seventhday observance but never the obligation of keeping one day in seven as the Sabbath.Notes  Great Purpose  Is 581314 shows that Sabbath applies to NT because Is 5358 are about New Covenant and Is 5625 mentions eunuchs and they could only enter Gods house in NT (Deut 231).  Is 5813 says we must not seek our own pleasure on the Sabbath. This refers to things in which we delight doing our own thing doing what we most enjoy or must do the other 6 days (business work play etc.).  Desisting from your own ways in Is 5813 means to cease business the affairs and responsibilities of everyday living.  In Is 581314 Isaiah applies prohibition of 4th Commandment that we arent to work or to work others. We must not pursue business other than works of necessity (Matt 1218) or mercy (Matt 12914).  According to Pipa on Sunday dont do homework or unnecessary housework. Dont watch TV go to sports games or play sports. Children and adults may need some physical activity. Moderate physical rest (not idleness) may be work of necessity. If a nap or vigorous walk are necessary to be alert on Sunday evening thats a necessity.  Original Intent  A moralpositive law gives instruction (positive law) for carrying out moral law. E.g. moral law requires monogamous marriage moralpositive law regulates whom one may marry. That moral law may not be changed but moralpositive law was changed without detracting from moral law. In same way moral law requires a regularly recurring amount of time to be allocated to worship but the day or period of time is a moralpositive law that can be changed without affecting moral law.  Ceremonial laws were temporary because necessity for them was temporary but need for Sabbath hasnt ceased so its not abrogated.  Market Day of the Soul  Term work in 4th Commandment is broader than labor and includes business trade commerce domestic chores.  4th Commandment requirement to let servants rest means not requiring our employees to do unnecessary work and avoiding shopping unnecessary dining out and recreation that causes others to work (such as watching pro sports). While traveling you may need to stay in a hotel or dine out by necessity.  4th Commandment required that Gentiles within Israels borders keep Sabbath. We may not legislate that people attend church but we should legislate that businesses be closed on Sunday.  Sign of the Covenant  There are ceremonial and civil aspects to 10 Commandments but that doesnt detract from their moral requirements.  Lord of the Sabbath  In Matt 1218 (and Mark 22328 Luke 615) Jesus doesnt do away with Sabbath he reestablishes it (see relation of Matt 112528 to Matt 121).  Jesus came into conflict with Jews about Sabbath 6 times and taught about Sabbath 6 times. This shows he didnt abrogate it.  Jesus defense of His disciples eating corn on Sabbath is that if it was proper for David and his men to violate a ceremonial law when Lords anointed was on Lords business on Sabbath then we may do things that strengthen us for Lords work on Sabbath. And just as priests did work necessary for worship on Sabbath we may do work necessary for preaching evangelizing worshipping on Sabbath.  Day for Compassion  Just as Israelite ships at sea had to perform necessary duties on Sabbath a modern factory may perform necessary duties if shutting down on Sunday would harm its work the rest of the week.  Examine your use of the day by asking Does this promote the purpose of the day Is good being done to my neighbor  physically but more importantly spiritually  Day Changed Obligation Unchanged  In Col 21617 sabbaths includes Jewish 7th day (Saturday) Sabbath among days that Christians dont need to observe. Rom 1446 and Gal 410 refer to Jewish ceremonial holy days. But Paul doesnt abrogate moral obligation of keeping 1 day in 7.  Paul worshipped on Sun (Acts 207) and commands churches to gather offerings in Sunday (1 Cor 1612).  When Paul says holy days are nonessential hes referring to the Jewish days about which there was dispute and diversity of opinion not to Sunday about which there was no dispute.  1stday worship referenced in Acts 207 1 Cor 1612 Rev 110. 7thday Sabbathkeeping prohibited in Col 21617.  First Day Sabbath  Heb 4313 says that we are not to look back but ahead because a Sabbath rest remains. V 9 uses sabbatismos which means Sabbathkeeping or observance.

What happens to the children when they touch Uncle Andrews magic rings is far beyond anything even the old magician could have imagined.Hurtled into the Wood between the Worlds the children soon find that they can enter many worlds through the mysterious pools there. In one world they encounter the evil Queen Jadis who wreaks havoc in the streets of London when she is accidentally brought back with them. When they finally manage to pull her out of London unintentionally taking along Uncle Andrew and a coachman with his horse they find themselves in what will come to be known as the land of Narnia.;221;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1308814770m65605.jpg;The Magicians Nephew (Chronicles of Narnia 6);fantasy paranormal;As a fan of The Chronicles of Narnia and a Christian I like C.S. Lewis creation story. Its obviously influenced by the first chapters of Genesis including many parallels to the Garden of Eden and its tempting forbidden fruit.  Its interesting that Aslan creates Narnia through song just as Lewis friend Tolkien records the Valar creating MiddleEarth and the rest of Ea in The Silmarillion. I liked learning more of Jadis backstory it adds more depth to her character than Lewis gives in The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe. Lewis uses Uncle Andrew to teach that no one is above the moral law and that those who meddle in things theyre not entitled to often suffer the consequences.  Lewis gives a lesson in prayer when Polly asks about Aslan Wouldnt he know without being asked and Fledge answers Ive no doubt he would. But Ive a sort of idea he likes to be asked. God being omniscient knows our needs but still instructs us to ask Him.  I prefer to read The Magicians Nephew in the order in which it was published (just before The Last Battle) rather than reading it first according to Narnian chronology. I feel it works better as backstory than as an introduction to Narnia.  The narration by Kenneth Branagh in the HarperCollins audiobook is excellent.  Favorite scenes   The Wood between the Worlds   The ancient dead city of Charn with its old sun   The Hall of Images in Charn   Aslan singing Narnia into existence   Aslan crying about Digorys mother   The explanation of the wardrobes origin and Digorys growing up to be Professor Kirke.  Favorite quotes  Evil will come of that evil but it is still a long way off and I will see to it that the worst falls upon myself. Aslan  [Jill] felt sure that [Aslans sound] was a call and that anyone who heard that call would want to obey it and (whats more) would be able to obey it however many worlds and ages lay between.  the Lion was not at all the sort of person one could try to make bargains with.  Polly Wouldnt he know without being asked  Fledge Ive no doubt he would. But Ive a sort of idea he likes to be asked.;C.S. Lewis

She must be defeated if Prince Rillian is to be saved.;243;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1336139237m65641.jpg;The Silver Chair (Chronicles of Narnia 4);fantasy paranormal;This is one of my favorite books in The Chronicles of Narnia series. It follows the formula of many medieval quests the heroes land in a predicament set out to make things right and encounter adventure along the way. Lewis fits many lessons about the Christian life into the story. Like the other Narnian tales the visitors from our world (Jill and Eustace) become better prepared for facing life in our world because of their experience in Narnia.  This book introduces one of my favorite Narnians Puddleglum a chronically pessimistic MarshWiggle. His negative outlook adds humor to the story.  There are also several interesting locations such as Underland an underground realm inhabited by gnomes named Earthmen. I really liked the journey through Underland especially the scene where they pass the sleeping Father Time and the Warden says They say he will wake at the end of the world. Remember this passage when you read The Last Battle. I also liked the description of Bism the land under Underland where jewels grow like fruit.  When Jill is pulled from England into Aslans country she tells Aslan that nobody called me and Scrubb you know. It was we who asked to come here. Scrubb said we were to call to...Somebody and perhaps the Somebody would let us in. And we did and then we found the door open. Aslan answers You would not have called to me unless I had been calling to you. Lewis gives this lesson in predestination although from our perspective we think we take the initiative in seeking Jesus we can only do that because Jesus first called us.  Throughout the story Jill and Eustace suffer the consequences of not remembering and following Aslans instructions. Their failure causes a lot of unnecessary trouble. The same occurs in our lives we only bring trouble to ourselves when we neglect or disobey Gods laws.  When the Black Knight mocks Puddleglum for believing that the letters carved in the City Ruinous were one of the signs Puddleglum responds There are no accidents. Our guide is Aslan and he was there when the giant King caused the letters to be cut and he knew already all things that would come of them including this. God is omniscient and foreknowing everything fits within His master plan.  The witch tries to convince Puddleglum Eustace and Jill that their memories of Narnia such as the sun and Aslan are simply objects they invented based on things they observe in her underground realm. She says You see When you try to think out clearly what this sun must be you cannot tell me. You can only tell me it is like the lamp. Your sun is a dream and there is nothing in that dream that was not copied from the lamp. The lamp is the real thing the sun is but a tale a childrens story...You have seen lamps and so you imagined a bigger and better lamp and called it the sun. Youve seen cats and now you want a bigger and better cat and its to be called a lion...And look how you can put nothing into your makebelieve without copying it from the real world of mine which is the only world. Of course the sun and Aslan the Lion do exist in Narnia. Christians are accused of believing in a God and a supernatural world that are simply delusional imaginings based on observable realities. Yet the truth remains regardless.  A dwarf remarks that the lesson of it all is...that those Northern witches always mean the same thing but in every age they have a different plan for getting it. Lewis point is that Satan never stops scheming to destroy Christians but he changes his tactics throughout history.  One of my favorite scenes from the entire Chronicles is Caspians arrival in Aslans country. After his death King Caspians body appears in Aslans country and Aslan and the others weep. Then Aslan has Eustace drive a thorn into his paw and a drop of blood resurrects Caspian and restores his youth. This scene serves not only to bring back a wellloved Narnian character its also a stirring reminder of Jesus sacrifice and a glimpse into His joyful welcoming of Christians into the afterlife.Even the Lion wept great Liontears ... And the dead King began to be changed. His white beard turned to grey and from grey to yellow and got shorter and vanished altogether and his sunken cheeks grew round and fresh and the wrinkles were smoothed and his eyes opened and his eyes and lips both laughed and suddenly he leaped up and stood before them  a very young man or a boy.  Favorite parts   Puddleglum with his pessimistic statements   Father Time seen in passing   Description of groves of live gems growing in Bism   Caspians arrival in Aslans country  Quotes  I darent come and drink said Jill.  Then you will die of thirst said the Lion.  Oh dear said Jill coming another step nearer.I suppose I must go and look for another stream then.  There is no other stream said the Lion.

The text pages are printed in black with green accents. It includes five full page illustrations in full color and many more in two color in addition to Thrors mapall prepared by the author.J.R.R. Tolkiens own description for the original edition If you care for journeys there and back out of the comfortable Western world over the edge of the Wild and home again and can take an interest in a humble hero (blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck) here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler. The period is the ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men when the famous forest of Mirkwood was still standing and the mountains were full of danger. In following the path of this humble adventurer you will learn by the way (as he did)if you do not already know all about these thingsmuch about trolls goblins dwarves and elves and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period. For Mr. Bilbo Baggins visited various notable persons conversed with the dragon Smaug the Magnificent and was present rather unwillingly at the Battle of the Five Armies. This is all the more remarkable since he was a hobbit. Hobbits have hitherto been passed over in history and legend perhaps because they as a rule preferred comfort to excitement. But this account based on his personal memoirs of the one exciting year in the otherwise quiet life of Mr. Baggins will give you a fair idea of the estimable people now (it is said) becoming rather rare. They do not like noise.;317;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Hobbit Or There and Back Again;fantasy paranormal;The Hobbit has been one of my favorite books since I read it as a highschool freshman. It works as a standalone fantasy story but its even better as an introduction to Tolkiens MiddleEarth The Lord of the Rings The Silmarillion The Children of Hurin Unfinished Tales of Numenor and MiddleEarth and the rest. The Hobbit hints at Tolkiens larger world with its mentions of the Necromancer the White Council magic rings Gondolin elves and Faerie in the west.  One of the storys main lessons is that greed and selfishness have consequences. In contrast the story shows the good that comes of honesty and integrity traits which Bilbo shows throughout. I like that the dwarves come to respect Bilbo.  The story is also about appreciating home safety and comfort. There are many times that Bilbo wishes for the comforts of home.  Gandalf immediately became my favorite character with his matteroffact speaking style mysterious comings and goings and the hints at his history and importance.  The first time I read the book I was surprised that its Bard who kills Smaug. I fully expected Bilbo to do it or at least one of the dwarves. It also took me a few readings to catch that Gandalf mentions Radagast to Beorn I didnt remember that his name appeared prior to The Fellowship of the Ring.  The unabridged audiobook narrated by Robert Inglis is outstanding.  If you like The Hobbit you simply must learn more of the backstory explained by Gandalf in Appendix A Part III Durins Folk of The Return of the King) and Unfinished Tales of Numenor and MiddleEarth.  For a detailed discussion of The Hobbit I highly recommend The Hobbit lecture by the Tolkien Professor.  Favorite scenes  Gandalfs first conversation with Bilbo.  The unexpected party when the dwarves and Gandalf make themselves at home at Bag End.  The encounter with the trolls.  Gollums introduction. When I first read it I wondered who and what this creature was and why he spoke to himself in the way he does.  Bilbo telling Smaug his names as riddles.  Bilbo offering the Arkenstone to Bard and the Elvenking.  Thorin making peace with Bilbo before Thorins death.  Favorite quotes  Good morning said Bilbo and he meant it.  What do you mean [Gandalf] said. Do you wish me a good morning or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not or that you feel good this morning or that it is a morning to be good on  Gandalf I am looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging and its very difficult to find anyone.  Bilbo I should think so  in these parts We are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things Make you late for dinner  ...dwarves are not heroes but calculating folk with a great idea of the value of money some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots some are not but are decent enough people like Thorin and Company if you dont expect too much.  If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold it would be a merrier world. Thorin  Gandalf to Bilbo You dont really suppose do you that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck Just for your sole benefit Youre a very fine person Mr. Baggins and Im quite fond of you. But you are really just a little fellow in a wide world after all.  Bilbo Thank goodness;J.R.R. Tolkien

There were a few good points but nothing compelling. Reading this book wasnt a very good use of my time.  Tips from the book  First Who then What  First get the right people on the bus (and the wrong people off it) then figure out where to drive. Having the right people in the company is more important than deciding what the company will do because the right people will help make that decision anyway. Whether a person is right or not depends on their character more than their knowledge and skills. Dont waste time dealing with people who arent contributing fire them ASAP.  Dont waste effort trying to motivate people the right people are selfmotivated. All you have to do is keep from demotivating them.  The Hedgehog Concept  To become great use the Hedgehog Concept concentrate on the point of intersection between what you are passionate about what you can be the best in the world at and what drives your economic engine. The Hedgehog Concept is named for the simple hedgehog that does one thing well (curling up for defense) and is able to defeat the crafty fox which knows many things but acts inconsistently.  A Culture of Discipline  Ignore onceinalifetime opportunities unless they fit in the 3 circles of the Hedgehog Concept.  Dont treat budgeting as allocating amounts of money to activities but choose Hedgehog Concept activities to fully fund and dont fund others. Stop doing lists are more important than to do lists.  Technology Accelerators  Does the technology fit directly with your Hedgehog Concept If yes then pioneer that technology. If not settle for parity with your competitors or ignore it.

994;79428;2;50548;0060652942;In the classic The Abolition of Man C.S. Lewis the most important Christian writer of the 20th century sets out to persuade his audience of the importance and relevance of universal values such as courage and honor in contemporary society. Both astonishing and prophetic The Abolition of Manis one of the most debated of Lewiss extraordinary works. National Reviewchose it as number seven on their 100 Best Nonfiction Books of the Twentieth Century.;113;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1418843138m79428.jpg;The Abolition of Man;nonfiction;Lewis comes to the defense of the Tao or Natural Law at a time when English schoolchildren were being taught progressive ideologies that claimed to debunk traditional morality. Maybe its because Im not familiar with the philosophical climate at the time he authored this but I didnt find this book particularly enlightening or Lewis arguments especially engaging. It could very well be that I simply wasnt careful enough in reading it and thus missed out Lewis writing requires your undivided attention.  Lewis shows that humans have agreed on certain universal values not because of instinct or for the sake of preserving the species but because these values have some deeper origin. He argues that you cant challenge the Tao from the outside because its the basis of our values system and there are no values outside it from which to judge it. We inherited it from our ancestors and grew up within it we dont know any external system.  Lewis a Christian wrote the book to be nonreligionspecific so he doesnt promote the Christian God as the source of the Natural Law. He says If we are to have any values at all we must accept the ultimate platitudes of Practical Reason as having absolute validity that any attempt having become skeptical about these to reintroduce value lower down on some supposedly more realistic basis is doomed. Whether this position implies a supernatural origin for the Tao is a question I am not here concerned with.  The appendix is entitled Illustrations of the Tao and groups quotes from civilizations of various historical periods geographic locations and religions into 8 illustrations of Natural Law. The quotes come from ancient Chinese Egyptian Australian Roman Babylonian Hindu Jewish Christian Norse and Greek sources. Here are the laws as Lewis presents them  Natural Law  The Law of General Beneficence  The Law of Special Beneficence  Duties to Parents Elders Ancestors  Duties to Children and Posterity  The Law of Justice  The Law of Good Faith and Veracity  The Law of Mercy  The Law of Magnanimity  Notes  Instinct isnt the origin of real values because theres nothing forcing us to obey instincts. Also instincts drive us to do many different often contradictory things.  If nothing is selfevident nothing can be proved. Similarly if nothing is obligatory for its own sake nothing is obligatory at all.  People attack traditional values (the Tao) in defense of rational or biological values but those values are themselves derived from the Tao not from outside it.  The Tao or Natural Law or Traditional Morality is not one among a series of possible value systems. Its the sole source of all value judgments. If its rejected all value is rejected. Supposed new ideologies are simply fragments of the Tao itself swollen to madness in their isolation.  The human mind has no more power of inventing a new value than of imagining a new primary colour or indeed of creating a new sun and a new sky for it to move in.  Advances in morality can only come from within the system (the Tao).  Men will try to condition future generations out of the Tao. If they were to succeed humans would cease to be human (by definition) so these efforts would lead to the abolition of man.  Mans triumph over Nature makes us both stronger and weaker we gain great abilities and efficiencies but suffer disadvantages such as the loss of simplicity and privacy.  Magic and science are twins. Both try to subdue reality and are ready to do what had previously been considered taboo or disgusting.;C.S. Lewis
995;83518;3;50548;0143037889;For over three decades Ray Kurzweil has been one of the most respected and provocative advocates of the role of technology in our future. In his classic The Age of Spiritual Machines he argued that computers would soon rival the full range of human intelligence at its best. Now he examines the next step in this inexorable evolutionary process the union of human and machine in which the knowledge and skills embedded in our brains will be combined with the vastly greater capacity speed and knowledgesharing ability of our creations.;652;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Singularity is Near When Humans Transcend Biology;nonfiction;This book has been referenced several times on TWiT podcasts so I finally wised up and read it. This is definitely not light reading  its 500 pages of chemistry biology computer science history and conjecture plus additional notes at the end.  The basic premise is that the rate of technological advances increases exponentially and that this will lead to a point around the year 2040 where humans become more nonbiological than biological. Well not only continue to integrate technology into our existing bodies and brains well go so far as to create virtual instantiations of ourselves in virtual reality doing away with the need for a physical body at all.  Kurzweil considers the human use of technology a continuation of the evolutionary process he says that evolution produced humans and humans produced technology so evolution is indirectly using technology to push us further than any other species and well transcend biology itself. Im a creationist so I dont agree with him on this point but his ideas of how humans will continue to enhance themselves and their environment with technology are still valid.  Kurzweil does an excellent job of explaining the factual science and reasoning behind his seemingly farfetched predictions about the future. He uses many examples from the history of computing as well as current research in the relevant scientific fields to chart a path to his vision of the future.  There were certain sections of the book that I found very interesting and read thoroughly while there were other sections where I found myself skimming long pages of boring data and logical arguments. I would have preferred an abridged version that presented his predictions and reasoning more succinctly.  Here are just a few of the interesting ideas discussed in this book  Reverseengineering the human brain until we can replicate all its advantages in computers.  Scanning the contents (skills memories personality etc.) of a persons brain and uploading them to virtual reality to create an immortal virtual person.  Slowing and eventually preventing aging and death with biotech.  Nanotechnology and how well use it in our bodies and the environment.  Enhancing the human body to create The Human Body 2.0 and 3.0.  Replacing our organs with nanobots.  Virtual reality.  Future warfare cyberwarfare and nanotech warfare.  Fasterthanlight (superlight) communication and travel.  Harnessing the matter and energy around us (Earth other objects in the solar system) for computing.  Computer consciousness and true artificial intelligence.;Ray Kurzweil

When the pair discover a deadly plot by the Calormen people to conquer the land of Narnia the race is on to warn the inhabitants of the impending danger and to rescue them all from certain death.;224;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1388210968m84119.jpg;The Horse and His Boy (Chronicles of Narnia 5);fantasy paranormal;This has always been my least favorite book in The Chronicles of Narnia. Its partially because of the characters instead of the familiar Pevensie children (visitors magically transported from our world) the main characters are natives of that world. In this story the Pevensies are adults during their Golden Reign and only appear briefly in Calormen and later in Narnia.  Calormen isnt as interesting a place as Narnia and C.S. Lewis meant it that way as it represents a culture based on slavery and a false religion. The country is mentioned in a couple other books but appears most prominently in this one and The Last Battle.  After reading The Chronicles of Narnia several times I see how this book fits into the overarching plot and theology of the series but it still feels like a misfit to me and I read it reluctantly.  The main theme of this story is providence the way God (portrayed by Alsan) directs events and supplies for the needs of His people. At one point Aslan reveals the role hes played in Shastas life from his infancy to the present he pushed Shastas boat to shore when he was a baby caused Shasta and Bree to meet Aravis and Hwin comforted Shasta and scared away the jackals by the Tombs terrified the horses into running to the Hermit and kept Shasta from falling off the precipitous trail.  Aslan shows how hes been guiding protecting and comforting Shasta all along without Shasta even being aware of it. Not all of the events seemed good to Shasta at the time and some were even injurious but they all worked to his benefit. Im reminded of Romans 828 And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God who have been called according to his purpose.  The concept of providence is further reinforced by the Hermit of the Southern March who says I ... have never yet met any such thing as Luck. There is something about all this that I do not understand but if ever we need to know it you may be sure that we shall.  A recurring theme in The Chronicles of Narnia is that people are only told about their own lives not others. When Aravis asks what happened to a servant girl Aslan says that no one is told any story but their own. Elsewhere he says that they can know only what has happened not what would have happened under different circumstances.  Theres a Doubting Thomas scene near the end. Bree is telling Hwin and Aravis that Aslan isnt a real lion but simply a metaphor that Narnians admire. In response Aslan approaches Bree and says You poor proud frightened Horse draw near...Do not Dare not to dare. Touch me. Smell me. Here are my paws here is my tail these are my whiskers. I am a true Beast. Notice the similarity to this excerpt from John 202429  But he [Thomas] said to them Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side I will not believe. Though the doors were locked Jesus came and stood among them and said Peace be with you Then he said to Thomas Put your finger here see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.  Favorite parts   Aslan reveals his involvement in Shastas life.   Shasta realizes that Aslan walked beside him to prevent him from falling down the cliff.  Favorite quotes  I ... have never yet met any such thing as Luck. There is something about all this that I do not understand but if ever we need to know it you may be sure that we shall. The Hermit of the Southern March  Who are you asked Shasta.  Myself said the Voice very deep and low so that the earth shook and again Myself loud and clear and gay and then the third time Myself whispered so softly you could hardly hear it and yet it seemed to come from all around you as if the leaves rustled with it.  Aravis also had many quarrels (and Im afraid even fights) with Cor but they always made it up again so that years later when they were grown up they were so used to quarreling and making it up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently.;C.S.

Complementing the look of the authors nonfiction books and anticipating the forthcoming Narnia feature films this edition contains an exclusive P.S. section about the history of the book plus a roundup of the first six titles.;224;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1308814830m84369.jpg;The Last Battle (Chronicles of Narnia 7);children; spoiler alert   A bittersweet end to The Chronicles of Narnia. This is C.S. Lewis Narnian rendition of the end of time clearly influenced by Revelation and other New Testament books of the Bible. Ive always felt that the story is too short and the battles scale seems too small. However the books second half is more interesting as it allegorically deals with Judgement Day and the afterlife. Of all the Chronicles this book raises the most theological questions for me. I dont completely agree with Lewis eschatology (end times doctrine) or soteriology (salvation doctrine).  I love how the sense of despair turns to great joy in eucatastrophe. I like the descriptions of the youth joy tirelessness and wonder of New Narnia and the reunions that occur there.  I liked the description of the New Narnia as containing all the best of the Old Narnia all the good things in Old Narnia were simply a shadow of the New just as Heaven will be a perfection of the current creation. Several unexpected characters appear in the New Narnia as well as characters from all the other Chronicles. In the New Narnia the Narnians can eat any fruit theres no longer any forbidden fruit as there was in the beginning of Narnia in The Magicians Nephew (or in the Garden of Eden).  Whenever I read this book Im disappointed by the fact that Susan seems to have fallen away and is no longer a friend of Narnia. Lewis doesnt reveal whether this is a temporary or permanent condition and I dont know if he was making a statement about Christians falling out of salvation.  Dont look too hard for parallels between this book and the Bible not all characters and events have a direct match. Shift the devious ape and Puzzle the dimwitted donkey together seem to represent Antichrist and possibly his false prophet. The Calormenes discover that Tash their diety actually exists. Maybe Lewis meant Tash to represent pagan deities which arent real or demons which are.  Shift tries to convince the Narnians that Puzzle is Aslan in order to earn their allegiance. Shift pressures Puzzle into playing along with his ploy showing that intellectuals often influence laypeople of weak faith. Shift says that Aslan doesnt show up these days just as modern intellectuals criticise the religious as being oldfashioned. Roonwit the centaur says The stars never lie but men and beasts do by which Lewis means that we must watch for the signs of Jesus coming and not be fooled by false prophets.  Puzzle is relatively innocent due to his gullibility and he later repents and enters the New Narnia. Im not sure what point Lewis may have been trying to make about Puzzles apparent salvation.  A major theme of the book is the danger of considering false religions and deities as equal to Christianity. Shift says that the Calormenes worship the same god as the Narnians Tash is Aslan and Aslan is Tash. Tash is only another name for Aslan. All that old idea of us being right and the Calormenes being wrong is silly ... The Calormenes use different words but we all mean the same thing. Tash and Aslan are only two different names for you know Who. Its not politically correct to elevate Christianity above the other religions were told we must treat all as equally valid.  Of course Shift doesnt actually believe in Aslan or Tash. Later Ginger the cat and Rishda Tarkaan agree that all who are enlightened know theres no Aslan or Tash. This is a common modern sentiment as well religion is seen as simply a crutch for the unenlightened.  The part of this book that Ive struggled the most with is the presence of the Calormene soldier Emeth in the New Narnia. Aslan tells Emeth I take to me the services which thou has done to [Tash]. I take to me the services which thou hast done to him. For I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oaths sake it is by me that he has truly sworn though he know it not and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name then though he says the name Aslan it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted.Emeth responds Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Aslan replies Unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.  Apparently Lewis left the doors to Heaven open quite widely. In The Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis Volume III he says I think that every prayer which is sincerely made even to a false god or to a very imperfectly conceived true God is accepted by the true God and that Christ saves many who do not think they know him. For He is (dimly) present in the good side of the inferior teachers they follow. In the parable of the Sheep and Goats those who are saved do not seem to know that they have served Christ.In this Lewis seems to contradict the Bibles teaching that belief in Jesus alone provides salvation see for example John 146 No one comes to the Father except through me.  Quotes  Noble death is a treasure which no one is too poor to buy.  Roonwit  And as He spoke He no longer looked to them like a lion but the things that began to happen after that were so great and beautiful that I cannot write them. And for us this the end of all the stories and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read which goes on for ever in which every chapter is better than the one before.;C.S.

After Angels  Demons this story seemed formulaic. Once again Robert Langdon is involved in a clash between the Catholic Church and an ancient secret society. A new woman joins his side in this adventure as he again races against time and an everchanging list of rivals to unravel the clues to the mystery du jour.  Despite the letdown after Angels  Demons this book was relatively entertaining. I like intelligent fiction so I enjoyed the way Brown wove history art architecture etymology symbology and conspiracy theories into the puzzles. However the ways in which the characters seem to always solve the riddles in the nick of time got repetitive and unrealistic. There are plenty of cliffhangers twists and unlikely friendships and betrayals to keep things interesting but the ending is pretty weak.  Ive been to France and the UK so I liked reading the scenes that took place at The Louvre Arc de Triomphe and Westminster Abbey.  Because Im a Biblebelieving Christian this book required some serious willing suspension of disbelief. The story claims that the Catholic Church has covered up the truth about Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene for 2000 years. Like most Christians I have a different word for this truth blasphemy.  The main character Langdon at one point claims that  Every faith in the world is based on fabrication...Metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible. The problems arise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors.  My advice read it (if you must) as entertainment not as a work of historical or religious accuracy.;Dan Brown

However my favorite parts of this book are the behindthescenes details about the Third Age. My favorite chapter is The Istari.  The book is a collection of Tolkiens manuscripts that have been edited by Christopher Tolkien. Its closer in style to The Silmarillion than The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings its more a history book than a story. However I find that enriches those other stories by the expanded background it contains.  For a detailed discussion of Unfinished Tales I highly recommend the Unfinished Tales Mythgard class by the Tolkien Professor.  Favorite parts   The description of the gates leading to Gondolin in Of Tuor and His Coming to Gondolin.   The Words of Hurin and Morgoth where Hurin taunts Morgoth.   Saurons invasion of Eriador to take the Nine Rings in The History of Galadriel and Celeborn.   Olorin presents the Elessar (Elfstone) to Galadriel as a gift from Yavanna to use for a while but to pass on to Elessar (Aragorn) in time. The History of Galadriel and Celeborn.   The legend of Isildurs death in The Disaster of the Gladden Fields.   King Elessar (Aragorn) finding treasures in Orthanc including Isildurs chain and the original Elendilmir (star of Elendil). The Disaster of the Gladden Fields.   The Quest of Erebor where Gandalf explains how grand events in MiddleEarth led him to arrange for Bilbos adventure in The Hobbit.   The Ringwraiths visit to Isengard and Sarumans conversation with them in The Hunt for the Ring.   Saurons and Sarumans efforts to find the One Ring in The Hunt for the Ring.   Gandalf and Sarumans tense conversation at the White Council of 2851 in The Hunt for the Ring.   The story The Faithful Stone in The Druedain.   The unveiling the nature and role of the wizards in The Istari.   The council of the Valar that resolved to send the Istari in The Istari.   The Palantiri explaining the significance and operation of the SeeingStones.  Notes   Thranduil constructed his underground fortress when he retreated from Souraon in Mirkwood. He used Doriath as an example. The History of Galadriel and Celeborn.   The Black Captain of the Ringwraiths woke the Barrowwights while some Riders entered the Shire. The Hunt for the Ring.  Quotes  The Words of Hurin and Morgoth  Hurin says to Morgoth Before Arda you were but others also and you did not make it. Neither are you the most mighty for you spent your strength upon yourself and wasted it in your own emptiness. No more are you now than an escaped thrall of the Valar. And their chain still awaits you...You are not the Lord of Men and shall not be though all Arda and Menel fall in your dominion. Beyond the Circles of the World you shall not pursue those who refuse you.Aldarion and Erendis  Aldarion says to Erendis For I think also of what it may be in time to come and the hope and splendour of its people and I believe that a gift should not lie idle in hoard.  Erendis replies Such gifts as come from the Valar and through them from the One are to be loved for themselves now and in all nows. They are not given for barter for more or for better. The Edain remain mortal Men Aldarion great though they be and we cannot dwell in the time that is to come lest we lose our now for a phantom of our own design.The Quest of Erebor  Gandalf says that Sauron planned to attack Lorien and Rivendell before reoccupying Mordor. Then he says that these three things came together the sturdy heavybooted Dwarves with their old burning grudge and the quick softfooted Hobbit sick at heart (I guessed) for a site of the wide world. Gandalf explains that Bilbo used to talk to Dwarves and Elves but later in life he was getting rather greedy and fat and his old desires had dwindled down to a sort of private dream. Gandalf tells Thorin that If this hobbit goes with you you will succeed. If not you will fail. A foresight is on me.  As Gandalf recounts this story Gimli asks if he planned everything. Gandalf answers I do not know the answer...Bilbo was meant to find the Ring and not by its maker and you [Frodo] were meant to bear it...and I was meant to guide you both to those points. To do that I used in my waking mind only such means as were allowed to me doing what lay in my hand according to such reasons as I had. But what I knew in my heart or knew before I stepped on these grey shores that is another matter. Olorin I was in the West that is forgotten and only to those who are there shall I speak more openly.Pippin asks why Gandalf chose Bilbo specifically. Gandalf replies I want a dash of the Took and I want a good foundation of the stolider sort a Baggins perhaps...And now I found that he was unattached...I learned that he had never married...I guessed that he wanted to remain unattached for some reason deep down which he did not understand himself.Gandalf recalls trying to convince Thorin to take Bilbo. He told Thorin Take a Hobbit with you Smaug has probably never heard of Hobbits and he has certainly never smelt them. Gandalf says of Bilbo I believe that in his heart he really desires to  to have as he would put it an adventure. Gandalf tells Thorin that he needs professional stealth and that hobbits are the most softfooted of all mortal kinds. Thorin interprets professional stealth as professional thief and Gandalf goes along with it which is why he refers to Bilbo as a burglar in The Hobbit.  The Istari  About the Istari For they must be mighty peers of Sauron but must forgo might and clothe themselves in flesh so as to treat on equality and win the trust of Elves and Men. But this would imperil them dimming their wisdom and knowledge and confusing them with fears cares and weariness coming from the flesh.The Palantiri  On why Saruman had allowed himself to be subjected to Sauron...Sarumans integrity had been undermined by purely personal pride and lust for the domination of his own will. His study of the Rings had caused this for his pride believed that he could use them or It in defiance of any other will. He having lost any devotion to other persons or causes was open to the domination of a superior will to its threats and to its display of power.;J.R.R. Tolkien Christopher Tolkien

Leftbrained (logical) thinking is still necessary but it needs to be paired with rightbrained thinking to form a Whole New Mind. The book has some good points about the value of soft skills but I didnt find it especially insightful. I liked the earlier chapters about career more than the later chapters about finding personal meaning and fulfillment probably because I already have a strong sense of purpose but Im still constructing my career path.  According to Pink the modern economy features Abundance (commoditization and a glut of products and services) Asia (inexpensive outsourced labor) and Automation (computerization). So any individual and business must answer three questions  1. Can someone overseas do it cheaper  2. Can a computer do it faster  3. Is what Im offering in demand in an age of abundance  Pink prescribes the solution high concept high touch. High concept is the ability to create artistic or emotional beauty detect patterns craft narratives and combine unrelated ideas into novel inventions. High touch is the ability to empathize understand subtleties of human interaction and pursue purpose and meaning. He says weve entered the Age of Art and Heart.  I agree that rightbrained thinking can provide a competitive advantage.

These books were my first foray into the fantasy world of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. As a child I understood the parallel to Jesus sacrifice for His people and today I still enjoy Lewis perspective on this tenant of the Gospel as well as his other insights into Christianity.  I read this book 2 years before I read the rest of The Chronicles of Narnia and 5 years before reading Tolkiens The Hobbit.  When I first read it I didnt understand all the references to GrecoRoman and pagan mythology but Ive come to appreciate them more over the years. Lewis borrows many other mythological characters including Father Christmas and (Lilith).  My favorite scenes   Winter ends and Spring unfolds to signify the Witchs waning power and Aslans return.   The descriptions of the real and mythical creatures in the opposing armies of Aslan and the Witch (mythical creatures fauns nymphs naiads dryads satyrs dwarfs giants centaurs unicorns minotaurs ogres hags wraiths efreets ettins etc.).   The Professor believes in the existence of Narnia and hints at a deeper knowledge of alternate worlds (further explored in The Magicians Nephew).  Quotes   Course [Aslan] isnt safe. But hes good. Hes the King I tell you. Mr. Beaver   Once a king or queen of Narnia always a king or queen ... Aslan   ... if [the Witch] could have looked a little further back into the stillness and the darkness before Time dawned she would have read there a different incantation. She would have known that when a willing victim who had committed no treachery was killed in a traitors stead the Table would crack and Death itself would start working backward. Aslan;C.S. Lewis

The first part introduces Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes and tells how they met. Holmes begins as an unknown eccentric insightful young man and quickly proves his abilities to Scotland Yard. I was confused when the second part started because it jumps from London to Utah with the Mormons settling Salt Lake City. It took me a while to realize that this story was connected to the first. Ive always liked Sherlock Holmes but had never read Doyles original works. Now I intend to read others.  I like the line Holmes delivers to Watson Theres the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life and our duty is to unravel it and isolate it and expose every inch of it.

The artwork is pretty good a variety of colors wellportrayed emotions and dynamic action scenes. Unfortunately the script falls short it seems written for modern teenagers who apparently have a much more limited vocabulary and greater use of slang than teens did in the 1960s (surprised). Id guess that only Spidey fans will enjoy this one.  Ive been a SpiderMan fan since childhood growing up on the 1990s cartoon and toys. I may have read a few of the comics at friends houses but they didnt interest me much. In the early 2000s Marvel rewrote most popular comic books to take place in the present day. Ultimate SpiderMan was one of those comics.  I read a few issues in high school because friends let me borrow them. When Marvel launched DotComics (a PC program for downloading and reading comics) in the early 2000s I downloaded as many free comics as I could many of them from the Ultimate line.  When I saw this book on the library shelf I recognized the Ultimate SpiderMan title from a decade ago. Since I wasnt able to get every issue from friends or online back in the day I checked it out.  I was somewhat disappointed. The trademark oneliners that PeterSpiderMan is known for spewing during fights were mostly lame. The stories werent particularly compelling. Theres not a lot of character development for Harry Osborn or Liz Allan. Mary Jane was the worst other than a few scenes of her studying shes mostly represented as vapid eye candy.  The story is based on the original but there are several changes for example Norman Osborn has Peter followed and he discovers that Peter obtained his spider powers from the spider bite in his lab.  The Green Goblin and Kingpin are the main villains but Electro and other minor ones appear as well.  One redeeming quality of this book came at the very end a fullcolor reprint of the original SpiderMan comic book Amazing Fantasy 15 from 1962 by Marvel legends Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.;Brian Michael Bendis Mark Bagley

I got through the first few chapters but had to return the book at the end of the class. I was just getting into the story so I intended to pick it back up later but never got around to it until now 7 years later  Im glad I completed the book this time. Although its a childrens book its worth reading for adults. The book tells the story of Jonas a 12 year old boy who lives in a highly regulated utopia in the future. In this future humans have determined that risk and pain should be removed from life. They accomplished their goal but also removed colors music happiness and love. Although the elders of Jonas village prefer it that way he doesnt and sets out to change it. This excerpt serves as a good summary of the setting  The community where his entire life had been lived lay behind him now sleeping. At dawn the orderly disciplined life he had always known would continue again without him. The life where nothing was ever unexpected. Or inconvenient. Or unusual. The life without color pain or past.Im not sure how the ending could have been improved but it seemed lacking. The story contains morals about the value of life memories friendships and love. The main lesson is that to fully enjoy life and all the good in it we must be willing to accept the painful parts of life as well.;Lois Lowry

I was reminded at many times of Star Wars The Hobbit (my review) The Lord of the Rings (my review) Harry Potter (my review) and other fiction. It contains the usual fantasy fare magic elves dwarves dragons swordplay a quest and desire for revenge. The vocabulary and plot are relatively simple but thats unsurprising because Paolini published it at age 15. The scale is small more like The Hobbit than The Lord of the Rings. Im sure I wouldve liked it more as a teen than at 27.  The character development is decent and I sympathized with Eragons misfortunes. Dragons being forces for good made for an interesting departure from most fantasy. Eragons telepathic link with Saphira was entertaining but was a plot device used too frequently and conveniently. I liked the description of the underground city Tronjheim.  The final battle isnt described in as much detail as I wouldve liked. The focus is on Eragons duel so the battle felt anticlimactic. The book ends with slight suspense but probably not enough to make me read the sequel Eldest.

His quest for something deeper and more meaningful than materialism created a work that gave form to some of mans deepest yearnings.

It was definitely a different type of book than I usually read because Thoreau records his daily activities and philosophical musings while living an experimental mostly selfsufficient life by Walden Pond.  He includes a lot of detail of the plants animals and people he saw and interacted with at the pond. These details had two effects they bored me silly but they also made his descriptions richer and more realistic. I could hear the loon and see the blue ice he talked about. I liked his many references to GrecoRoman mythology which always lends an air of intellect to literature. However other than being able to pick out a few famous quotes as I read this book wasnt worth my time.  The copy I read contained not only Walden but also Civil Disobedience Slavery in Massachusetts A Plea for Captain John Brown and Life Without Principle. I passed on Slavery in Massachusetts and A Plea for Captain John Brown after reading a few pages but I did read Civil Disobedience and Life Without Principle. Notes follow.  Walden  People act like machines working their lives away and not enjoying it.  Instead of studying how to make it worth mens while to buy my baskets  I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling them.  I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if I could not learn what it had to teach and not when I came to die discover that I had not lived.  A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.  Not till we are lost in other words not till we have lost the world do we begin to find ourselves and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations.  For I was rich if not in money in sunny hours and summer days and spent them lavishly nor do I regret that I did not waste more of them in the workshop or the teachers desk.  As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.  Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.  We should be blessed if we lived in the present always and took advantage of every accident that befell us.  Our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and meadows which surround it. We need the tonic of wildness.  Nay be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you opening new channels not of trade but of thought.  Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises If a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears how ever measured or far away.  Civil Disobedience  Thoreau spent a night in jail for refusing to pay his taxes. In this work he explains his belief that government is too involved in the lives of Americans and just gets in the way. He believes that the government cant do anything without the consent of the people. He says that slavery and war are wrong and refuses to pay the government that supports them. In fact he objects to paying for any society that he didnt sign up for the local church the state and the federal government. His motto That government is best which governs least.  Life Without Principle  Thoreau rages against the trivial things that people waste their time on especially news and gossip. He says hed rather fill his mind with nature than useless facts and gossip.  Read not the Times. Read the Eternities.  The aim of the laborer should be not to get his living to get a good job but to perform well a certain work and even in a pecuniary sense it would be economy for a town to pay its laborers so well that they would not feel that they were working for low ends as for a livelihood merely but for scientific or even moral ends. Do not hire a man who does your work for money but him who does it for love of it.;Henry David Thoreau

But in the end it is a battle of honor between two men alone that will decide the fate of an entire world.;240;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1308814880m121749.jpg;Prince Caspian (Chronicles of Narnia 2);fantasy paranormal;Another strong Narnian tale though not as good as The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.  At the end of Lion the Pevensies leave Narnia in its Golden Age but in this book they find that time has brought unwelcome changes to the land and they act as catalysts for its restoration.  This book doesnt parallel any biblical stories as closely as The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe but C.S. Lewis still fits in many Christian lessons. Lewis teaches about blind faith when Aslan remains invisible to the Pevensies and they must learn to trust him despite not being able to see him.  Later when the Old Narnians find themselves in dire straights and Aslan hasnt come yet they argue about summoning the White Witch to help them instead. Nikabrik has serious doubts about Aslan saying Yes they say [that Alsan returned from the dead] but youll notice that we hear precious little about anything he did afterwards. He just fades out of the story. How do you explain that if he really came to life Isnt it much more likely that he didnt and that the stories say nothing more about him because there was nothing more to say Nikabrik here represents those who doubt the historicity of the Gospels. Of course the Old Narnians soon learn that Aslan is alive and quite close.  Near the end of the book Aslan tells the Telmarines that You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve. And that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth. Although humans were made in Gods image they fell into sin and corruption.  I first read this book in 6th grade having learned that Lion was not a standalone book but part of a series. Ive always wished more of the Chronicles included all four Pevensie children as Lion and this one do.  My favorite parts   The Pevensies rediscover Cair Paravel.   Caspian finds the Old Narnians in hiding.   Aslan makes himself visible to the Pevensies onebyone.   The tree people (dryads hamadryads sylvans).   Reepicheeps character.   The Old Narnians fight over summoning the White Witch to help them.   Aslan Bacchus and Silenus liberate the Narnians from their restricted civilized lives.   Aslan tells the Telmarines the story of their origin.  Quotes  But every year you grow you will find me bigger. Aslan to Lucy  She said Oh Aslan I knew it was true. Ive been waiting for this all my life. Have you come to take me away  Yes Dearest said Aslan. But not the long journey yet.  You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve said Aslan. And that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth.;C.S. Lewis

1013;140225;5;50548;006112527X;Lucy and Edmund with their dreadful cousin Eustace get magically pulled into a painting of a ship at sea. That ship is the Dawn Treader and on board is Caspian King of Narnia. He and his companions including Reepicheep the valiant warrior mouse are searching for seven lost lords of Narnia and their voyage will take them to the edge of the world. Their adventures include being captured by slave traders a muchtooclose encounter with a dragon and visits to many enchanted islands including the place where dreams come true.This edition follows the original numbering scheme. More recent publishers have renumbered the volumes so that the books are ordered chronologically. This was reportedly the authors preference. Other editions number this book as 5.Please respect the title as printed.;248;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1343185059m140225.jpg;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (Chronicles of Narnia 3);children; spoiler alert   This might be the most surreal of The Chronicles of Narnia. Its different from the other Narnia books in that its a nautical journey none of which occurs within Narnian borders. It has more variety than many of the other books because its a series of adventures occurring on several islands and the sea between them. Like the other Narnia books its full of Biblical allegory and lessons about Jesus and faith.  When Caspian et al. visit The Lone Islands C.S.Lewis makes the point that materialism shouldnt trump morality. Governor Gumpas tries to justify the slave trade saying that its necessary unavoidable. An essential part of the economic development of the islands...Our present burst of prosperity depends on it. Caspian responds that he doesnt see that the slave trade actually brings necessary imports to the island but whether it does or not it must be stopped. Gumpas objects that that would be putting the clock back and would slow progress and development. Lewis uses this scene to show that neither economics nor progress are valid arguments for compromising morals.  When Eustaces selfishness and greediness turn him into a dragon he finds himself unable to transform himself back. Only Aslan is able to restore his humanity teaching us that were helpless to save ourselves from sin and reliant on Jesus for salvation.  There are several times where Aslan appears and snaps people out of sinful dreams. On Deathwater Edmund and Caspian their eyes glistening with visions of treasure begin to fight over the water that turns anything it touches to gold. They snap back to reality when they see Aslan on a nearby hill. Later in the magicians house Lucy is about to cast a spell to make herself incredibly beautiful then sees Aslan on a page startling her back to her senses. Sometimes God acts in our lives to prevent us from sinning.  There are many other Christian lessons. When Lucy laments that shes forgetting the most beautiful story shes ever read Aslan promises to tell it to her for years and years. Just before he vanishes from the Magicians house Aslan tells Lucy I call all times soon. On Ramandus Island Ramandus daughter describes faith when she says that You cant know. You can only believe  or not.  At the end of the book Lucy asks Will you tell us how to get into your country from our world Aslans reply echoes biblical passages about the journey of life and death I shall be telling you all the time. But I will not tell you how long or short the way will be only that it lies across a river. But do not fear that for I am the great Bridge Builder.  On the last page Lewis shows us why he wrote The Chronicles of Narnia for children. In one of my favorite parts of the series Lucy cries We shant meet you [in our world]. And how can we live never meeting you and Aslan says  But you shall meet me dear one. But there I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia that by knowing me here for a little you may know me better there.  My favorite scenes   Eustaces pessimistic diary.   Eustaces transformation into a dragon and Aslan restoring his humanity.   Coriakins house especially the spell book.   The otherworldliness of the chapters The Wonders of the Last Sea and The Very End of the World with the sea people sweet water and stunning brightness.   Aslans parting conversation with Lucy and Edmund.  Quotes  Have you no idea of progress of development Gumpas  I have seen them both in an egg said Caspian. We call it Going Bad in Narnia  Eustace had read only the wrong books. They had a lot to say about exports and imports and governments and drains but they were weak on dragons.  ... did I not explain to you once before that no one is ever told what would have happened Aslan  Shall I ever be able to read that story again the one I couldnt remember Will you tell it to me Aslan Oh do do do.  Aslan Indeed yes I will tell it to you for years and years.  I call all times soon. Aslan  Lucy Will you tell us how to get into your country from our world  Aslan I shall be telling you all the time. But I will not tell you how long or short the way will be only that it lies across a river. But do not fear that for I am the great Bridge Builder.  Lucy We shant meet you there. And how can we live never meeting you  But you shall meet me dear one said Aslan.  Are  are you there too Sir said Edmund.  I am said Aslan. But there I have another name.

It covers six broad marketing strategies with advice and detailed examples. It includes a 28day program for putting the information into action. Youre supposed to start seeing results by the end of the program but to keep repeating it to be effective. Its aimed at professionals and consultants operating as selfemployed and very small businesses but much of the advice can be applied more generally.  I liked that Hayden ranks strategies by their effectiveness and considers the cost and time required.  I read this because Im seeking to improve the marketing of my web design agency OptimWise. This book was recommended by Cory Miller founder of iThemes. Ive also heard it recommended by others.  What Really Works Effective Marketing Strategies  Marketing strategies for professional services most to least effective  Type of strategy is in parentheses.  1. Direct contact and followup (outreach)  2. Networking and referral building (outreach and credibility)  3. Public speaking (visibility and credibility)  4. Writing and publicity (visibility and credibility)  5. Promotional events (visibility)  6. Advertising (visibility)  Direct contact and followup   Must personalize initial communication otherwise its just direct mail which is advertising (least effective). Subsequent contact can be impersonal such as newsletters or mailings but use personal contact for interested prospects.   Tactics warm calls lunchcoffee personal letteremail send links to useful articles invite to thirdparty seminars newsletters.  Networking and referral building  Tactics develop referral partners (people who serve the same clients).  Public speaking   Speak to existing groups rather than hosting your own event.   Tactics make announcements or introductions at group meetings serve on panels do webinars or web chats give classesworkshops.  Writing and publicity   Start small (blog newsletters) before graduating to larger publications.   Use ghost writers and editors as necessary.   Always provide the media with a story. Tell why their audience will be interested.   Dont expect a flock of new prospects these efforts slowly build credibility and name recognition.   List publications and media appearances in your marketing kit or website.   Once youve appeared in one media outlet others will be eager to have you.   Tactics write a regular column contact journalists or bloggers when they discussed your area of expertise (and they may contact you next time).  Promotional events   Can be expensive compare cost per lead to other marketing methods.   Tactics free demos or workshops to hot prospects online demos or workshops open house reception cosponsor events with nonprofits or colleagues host networking lunch breakfast or mixer.  Advertising   Advertising usually must be coupled with direct contact and followup to pay off.   If your clients usually select your services by referral advertising is probably a waste. If they use advertising to make their decision you may consider it.   Display ads in the newspaper magazines and trade journals are more for visibility than direct response. You usually need a big budget and repeat advertising.   Directmail is much less effective than personal letters and are often a waste.   Tactics SEO web directories.  What Really Works Effective Marketing Strategies cont.   In professional services marketing and sales are separate. Think of every marketing strategy as a sales strategy and vice versa.   Better to get multiple exposures to a smaller target group than get fewer exposures to more people.  Putting the System into Action  Choose only the action items that reflect who you are and what you like to do. The only thing youre required to become good at is talking to people so they understand what you offer and that you can help them.  Dont let the work you already have your excuse for not finding the class you really need. Make marketing your first priority instead of the last thing you do.  Everyone you meet is either a prospect or a potential source of referrals. Never pass up an opportunity to introduce yourself.  Acknowledge your progress dont only reward results. Marketing is a skill learned over time.  Filling the Pipeline When You Dont Know Enough People to Contact  In marketing more of the same works much better than a little of everything.  If you cant narrow your niche definition to one target market or specialty define two or three distinct ones. Example executives established professionals and successful entrepreneurs.  10second introduction state key benefit of service before giving occupation or job title.  When contacting someone new call before you mailemail and call again after your mail. Mailemail without call isnt nearly as effective.  Rather than asking if people can think of anyone to refer you to narrow the frame of reference. For example ask if anyone they golf with or are in Rotary with etc. could benefit from your service.  Public speaking is effective largely due to the perceived endorsement of the group hosting the event and the fact that the group invites attendees. Hosting your own talk webcast podcast etc. is a promotional event and much less effective.  When collecting leads ask a qualifying question.  Leads from advertising take more convincing are more likely to ask for a lower price and require a longer sales cycle than those from other marketing methods.  Following Up When You Know Plenty of People but Youre Not Contacting Them  When following up alternate emails with phone calls. Email is too easy to hide behind and is too hard to gauge interest.  Dont make contacts feel wrong for not returning messages. Instead of saying I havent heard from you say youre eager to speak with them. Sendleave 3 messages in a 10day period then wait a month and repeat.  If the sale seems worth it dont quit contacting.  Closing Sales When Youre Making Appointments but Not Getting Sales  Answering objections  General advice Agree with what the prospect says then ask an openended question that leads the conversation back to how your service can be of value.  If the prospect says We cant afford to spend that much say Yes I know the prices significant. Let me ask you what is it costing you not to fix it or Yes its a big investment. What results would make that kind of investment worthwhile  If the prospect says I need to think about it  Say Its a big decision and Im sure you do. Tell me what are some of your concerns  If the prospect says We are too busy right now say I know how busy you are. Tell me if you dont deal with the situation now when will you be less busy  If the prospect says Im not sure youre right for the job say Yes I know that you may have concerns about that. What would you need to feel confident about in order to hire me;C.J. Hayden

Grahams philosophy of value investing  which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop longterm strategies  has made The Intelligent Investorthe stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949.;304;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Intelligent Investor The Classic Text on Value Investing;nonfiction;If you read investing books or magazines youve undoubtedly heard of Benjamin Graham. Hes considered the father of value investing and Warren Buffett is one of his disciples. In fact The Oracle of Omaha called this book the best book about investing ever written.  I have to disagree with Buffett on this one but thats because Im a very different type of investor than Buffett. Im a Boglehead (follower of Vanguard founder John Bogle) so I invest through broadly diversified passive index funds instead of individual stocks and bonds. I read this book to learn Grahams general investing advice and opinion of the market not to learn his formulas for analyzing the values of stocks and bonds.  Much of the books data is understandably stale since it was first published in 1949. You can definitely tell it was written in the preInternet era of investing before people had easy access to mutual funds ETFs 401(k)s IRAs and day trading.  Although the financial world has changed much since his time Grahams fundamentals remain solid. For most investors he recommends a diverse portfolio of bonds and stocks held for the longterm. He strongly advises against trying to time the market and says to never invest in something you dont understand. Graham warns against being an emotional investor he says to invest based on arithmetic not optimism.  To achieve satisfactory investment results is easier than most people realize to achieve superior results is harder than it looks.  The real money in investing will have to be made  as most of it has been in the past  not out of buying and selling but out of owning and holding securities receiving interest and dividends and benefiting from their longterm increase in value.  Notes  Graham divides investors into 2 camps defensive and enterprising. The defensive investor is riskaverse seeking to preserve capital and obtain a reasonable return. The enterprising investor is more risktolerant willing and able to analyze stocks and bonds to find higher returns.  Defensive portfolio   2575 US bonds depending on investors risk tolerance and situation   common stocks of leading or prominent US companies (blue chips) purchased at a reasonable price based on historical data  Enterprising portfolio   buy low sell high   growth stocks   value stocks   take advantage of special situations like mergers and acquisitions business reorganizations etc.  You cant forecast or time the market.  Unless youre forced to sell your shares you shouldnt care about share prices. Ignore the daily ups and downs of the market.  Use dollar cost averaging or formula timing plans to remove the psychological factors of investing.  Risk vs safety  Risky investments are those that have a chance of declining in price but a history of positive returns. You dont care about temporary declines as long as you hold the investment because its not until you sell that the decline would be realized.  Unsafe investments are those with history of poor returns over many years these are not wise investments.  Prices sometimes reflect the present and sometimes reflect the future because you cant tell which its hard to determine if stocks are fairly priced.  Margin of safety  Margin of safety is the secret to sound investing.  This is a business value over its debt (its ability to earn more than it needs to cover its expenses) or the difference between price and value.  Guarantees a better chance of profit than loss (not a guaranteed profit).  Diversification across several stocks increases the certainty of profit.  The margin is based on statistical data not speculation.;Benjamin Graham John C. Bogle

It goes through all seven books in chronological order. There are two pages for each chapter with definitions of unfamiliar words tips for adults reading to kids biblical parallels questions for discussion and trivia or activities. The end of the book has several chapters for adults.  I learned less than I expected but to be fair Ive read several books on the series. Also this book is a family guide with at least as much content for kids as adults.  My favorite chapters were A Boy Named Jack Lets Talk About The Chronicles The Meaning of Magic in Narnia Color and Culture in Narnia and Bible Allusions  Parallels.  Notes  Lewis Inspiration  Many things in Lewis life influenced the Chronicles including having an unfortunate name a nurse who told mythological stories making stories about talking mice sailing ships his mother being very ill boarding school bullies a big house in the country with a professor burying treasures in the garden children living with him in the country during World War II and a pessimist gardener.  The lowest stone at Stonehenge called the stone of sacrifice may have inspired the Stone Table.  Tashbaan is very similar to ancient Tashkent an oasis city in central Asia.  Lets Talk About The Chronicles  The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe   Peter sword and shield (leadership faith)   Lucy healing tonic (compassion healing)   Susan bow and arrow and horn (prayer)  The Last Battle  The ancient Roman fable by Avianus has a donkey in a lionskin.  Emeth Is Hebrew for truth. Emeth suggests that anyone who truly seeks the truth is seeking Jesus who is Truth (Acts 103435). Emeths story is similar to the stories of the African official (Acts 82639) and the Roman commander (Acts 10).  The Meaning of Magic in Narnia  Recognizing Narnia as both fiction and fantasy can help Christian moms and dads get through the squirmy material. We can affirm that the Bible condemns sorcery and black magic in our world because they do exist as tools of a real devil on a real Planet Earth. But we can also know ... that Narnia is in a different category. ... Narnian magic which is madeup is different from earthly black magic which is often real.  Color and Culture in Narnia   Chronicles were written in 1950s after two world wars when nationalism and colonialism were in peoples minds.   Lewis probably chose dark skin for Narnias enemies because it was the opposite of the protagonists white skin. In a way it was like a team uniform.   Its the Dwarfs bad characters who use the word darkies not Lewis.   When Tirian says he feels a true man again after removing his fake dark skin color he means that hes glad hes no longer hiding and hes now distinguishable from his enemies not that hes white.   Lewis says positive things about Calormen and Tashbaan and has good Calormenes (Aravis and Emeth).  Bible Allusions  Parallels  The Magicians Nephew   Singing stars singing stars of Creation (Job 387).   Aslans tree brings healing heavens trees will heal (Ezekiel 4712).  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader   Aslan says Do you think I wouldnt obey my own rules Jesus said he didnt come to abolish the Law (Matthew 51718).   Caspian says hell choose from those he invites Jesus said Many are invited but few are chosen (Matthew 2214).  The Silver Chair  Aslan tells Jill to repeat the signs in the morning and night Moses instructed Israel to talk about Gods commands when you lie down ... and when you get up (Deut. 67).  The Last Battle   The children are revived by water trickling from a rock God gave Israel water from a rock (Numbers 2011).   Ginger is struck dumb for lying about Aslan Elymas was blinded for lying (Acts 1311).   The old Narnia is a shadow or copy of the real Narnia Moses sanctuary was a copy and shadow of what is in heaven (Hebrews 85).;Heather Harpham Kopp David Kopp Martin French

I liked the themes of taking responsibility and continuously improving. It discusses success not only in financial terms but also mental emotional and physical (bodily). Its somewhat overly optimistic at times but far less cheesy than I expected.  The giant within in the title is decision. Our decisions about how we think how we feel and what we do...will determine the quality of our present and future.  I liked the chapter on The Power of Life Metaphors which talks about the psychological effects of words.  I realize this isnt a theology book but there were a couple items I didnt completely agree with. Robbins says that Gods delays are not Gods denials. Although this is sometimes true its not universally true. Sometimes (often actually) God denies us things that we want because He knows best. In another place Robbins applies Matthew 77 (Seek and ye shall find) to our material lives even though in that passage Jesus is speaking of spiritual things.  I read this book because I had heard it referenced several times and it was included in SelfHelp Classics.  Notes  Mastery   Mastery takes as long as you want it to take. Take action more frequently to decrease time to mastery.   The most powerful way Ive learned to compress time is to learn through other peoples experience.  Conditioning   People will do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure.   To condition effectively reward or punish immediately after incident.   Use a variable schedule of reinforcement. For example dolphins are sometimes rewarded after first jump sometimes after fifth etc. This encourages them to perform consistently.   Offer jackpots occasional unexpected surprises to reinforce behavior.  Goals   If you have a big enough why to do something  a strong enough set of reasons  you can always figure out how to achieve it.   Ask yourself What kind of person will I have to become in order to achieve all that I want   Most of us have created numerous ways to feel bad and only a few ways to feel truly good. You could be winning and feel like youre losing because the scorecard youre using is unfair. Change your rules so its easy to feel good and hard to feel bad.

Its full of good reminders but I didnt create any todos (as I usually do for actionable nonfiction). By the end of the book I was asking myself Am I living the life Ive been called to  To be fair I do a lot of reading and listening about mindset. In addition I was in a community leadership development program last year went through a boot camp for web agency owners earlier this year and am currently in a mastermind for web agency owners. All of them discussed the importance of mindset.  This book shows how the right mindset is the key to success. It tells how by changing your thinking you can change your life and the lives of others. It ends with May thinking become your greatest tool for creating the world you desire.  Notes  Focused Thinking  Strike a balance between being accessible to those you lead and withdrawing from them to think. Walking slowly through the crowd allows me to connect with people and know their needs. Withdrawing from the crowd allows me to think of ways to add value to them.  Practice the 108010 principle with people to whom you delegate. Help with the first 10 by casting vision laying down parameters providing resources encouraging. Once they do the middle 80 help them take it the rest of the way (last 10).  Creative Thinking  Its easy to connect the dots if you know where youre going. Likewise its easy to connect ideas when you have a plan.  Realistic Thinking  Why not learn all that you can from good thinkers who have faced similar situations in the past Some of my best thinking has been done by others  Possibility Thinking  Choose to think positively especially when it doesnt come naturally. George Lucas said Im very cynical and as a result I think the defense I have against it is to be optimistic.  If you dont want to get into positive thinking just eliminate all the negative thoughts.  When you start telling yourself how something wont work stop yourself and ask Whats right about this  Dream one size bigger set goals at least a step beyond what makes you comfortable.  Question Popular Thinking  Challenge the process. The greatest enemy of tomorrows success is sometimes todays success.  Shared Thinking  Two heads are better than one  when they are thinking in the same direction. Its like harnessing two horses to pull a wagon. ... when they pull together they can move more weight than the sum of what they can move individually.;John C. Maxwell

He is the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city He is a genius a philosopher an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless like a spider in the center of its web but that web has a thousand radiations and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans.  Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things our powers our desires our food are all really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.  I have always held too that pistol practice should be distinctly an openair pastime and when Homes in one of his queer humours would sit in an armchair with his hairtrigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet pocks I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.;Arthur Conan Doyle

Le Morte DArthur looks back to an idealized Medieval world and is full of wistful elegiac regret for a vanished age of chivalry.

I stopped at Book V The First and the Second Book of Sir Tristrams de Lione.  As expected theres a lot of chivalry heroism and fighting (especially duals). I was somewhat surprised to find that Christianity plays more of a political or cultural role than a moral one several knights show no qualms about adultery as one example.  I started reading this because Arthurian legend has greatly influenced Western culture and I want to know the stories better.

1028;223479;3;50548;0877847940;Christ is coming again. Since the first century Christians have agreed that Christ will return. But since that time there have also been many disagreements. How will Christ return When will he return What sort of kingdom will he establish What is the meaning of the millennium These questions persist today. Four major views on the millennium have had both a long history and a host of Christian adherents. In this book Robert G. Clouse brings together proponents of each view George Eldon Ladd on historic premillenniallism Herman A. Hoyt on dispensational premillennialism Loraine Boettner on postmillennialism and Anthony A. Hoekema on amillennialism. After each view is presented proponents of the three competing views respond from their own perspectives. Here youll encounter a lively and productive debate among respected Christian scholars that will help you gain clearer and deeper understanding of the different ways the church approaches the meaning of the millennium.;224;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Meaning of the Millennium Four Views;nonfiction;This book explores four major eschatological views. I like the format each view is explained in an essay by an adherent of that view and each essay is followed by three responses (one from each adherent of the other views).  I felt the amil essay made the strongest case. The postmil essay cites little Scripture and instead relies heavily on stats to show that the world is improving in many ways. The essay was an abbreviated form of Boettners book The Millennium.  The four contributors are  Historic premil George Eldon Ladd  Dispensational premil Herman A. Hoyt  Postmil Loraine Boettner  Amil Anthony A. Hoekema  Ive heard of two of the contributors (Hoekema and Boettner) but Im not familiar with any of the four to know how well they represent adherents to their views.  Intro  Premil was dominant in first three centuries. Amil became dominant in fourth century. Augustine held it. It was dominant in Middle Ages. Reformers were amil but Luther and Calvin were cautious in interpretation. Postmil became popular in 18th century. Premil regained popularity in 19th century when dispensational understanding came about.  Historic premil  New Testament shows Old Testament prophecies are fulfilled in church. Matthew 215 817 Acts 83235 Romans 92426.  Church as spiritual Israel shown in Romans 411 16 22829 Gal 37 19 Philippians 33 Hebrews 8812.  Revelation 2016 is only passage that speaks of millennium but 1 Corinthians 152326 may refer to a kingdom before the end.  Postmil response to historic premil  The idea of a provisional kingdom in which glorified saints and mortal men mingle finds no support anywhere in Scripture.  And so all Israel shall be saved (Romans 1126) doesnt refer to literal ethnic Israel it refers to Gods people. Gal 37 22829 616 Eph 21416. Israel ceased to be Gods special people (Matthew 2143 1 Thessalonians 216).  Historic premil response to dispensational premil  Restoration of bloody sacrifices conflicts with Hebrews 813.  Postmil response to dispensational premil  All promises made to Israel in Old Testament either were fulfilled or forfeited through disobedience. Israel was repeatedly warned that apostasy would cancel promise of future blessings. Deuteronomy 281325 4546 Jeremiah 18910 1 Sam 230.  When Christ comes again it wont be to establish an earthly kingdom. Kingdom came at Christs first coming. Mark 91 Colossians 113 Revelation 156.  Amil response to dispensational premil  Jesus isnt king of an earthly kingdom. John 183637.  New Testament doesnt teach separate future for believing Israel and believing nonIsraelites. Ephesians 21416 Romans 111724 1 Peter 29.  Old Testament passages dispensationalists claim refer to millennium actually refer to new earth or final state of blessedness.  New Testament frequently gives figurative interpretation of Old Testament concepts of Zion Jesus Holy Land Kingdom seed of Abraham sacrifices temple. One example Acts 151417.  New Testament doesnt predict future restoration of Israel as a nation. Promises are fulfilled in Jesus resurrection and forgiveness of sins. Acts 133234 38.  Postmil  Salvation is for an incredibly large number not a small select group. Psalm 472 975 Zechariah 910 Revelation 7910.  Heaven is pictured as large (the next world a kingdom a country a city) while hell is pictured as comparatively small (prison lake of fire pit). Angels and saints are called hosts myriads innumerable multitude ten thousand times ten thousand no such language is used used for lost.  High moral and spiritual life of millennium will result in material prosperity. Matthew 633 1 Timothy 48 Isaiah 351.  Millennium is result of long slow process. Luke 1720 Mark 428 Isaiah 2810.  Amil response to postmil  Revelation 2046 doesnt refer to ruling with Christ of believers who are still on Earth and havent yet died but to ruling with Christ of souls of believers who have died.  Luke 188 suggests that the number of true believers will be small when Christ returns.  Amil  Revelation 111 describes church on earth persecuted by world. Revelation 1220 gives spiritual background of this struggle describing persecution by Satan and his helpers.  Revelation consists of 7 sections which run parallel to each other each of which depicts church in world from Christs first to second coming. Last section starts with Revelation 20 so Revelation 2016 covers beginning of New Testament era. It can be see by Revelation 20 describing Satans defeat and doom which began with Christs first coming described in Revelation 1279. Millennial reign of Revelation 2046 occurs before second coming seen by final judgment in verses 1115 pictured as coming after millennium. Final judgment is associated with second coming in New Testament. Revelation 2212 Matthew 1627 253132 Jude 1415 2 Thessalonians 1710.  Thousand years isnt literal multiple of 10 indicates completeness.  Structure of Revelation and Revelation 20715 show this thousand years represents time between first and second coming.  Structure of Revelation and Revelation 2013 represents Satans activity being curbed not place of final punishment (which is called lake of fire.)  In Old Testament at least after Abraham nations were deceived by Satan and only Israel had special revelation. Satan was bound so Great Commission could succeed.  While bound Satan can still do harm he just cant prevent nations from learning about God as he did in Old Testament. Matthew 1229 Luke 101718 John 123132 show Satan was bound at Christs first coming.  Revelation 2046 mention thrones and all but 3 of the 47 mentions of thrones in Revelation refer to heaven so verses 46 show heaven whereas verses 13 show earth.  In Revelation 2046 those on thrones are souls whove been beheaded so theyre not on earth.  Those who had not worshipped the Beast refers to Christians who resisted antiChristian powers.  There will be only one bottle resurrection that includes believers and unbelievers (John 52829 Acts 415). So v 4 cant refer to bodily resurrection. Those who came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years are souls in heaven (Revelation 321). This living and reigning continues throughout gospel era.  Nothing in Revelation 2046 refers to earthly millennial reign. Rest of the dead in verse 5 refers to unbelievers.  First resurrection is transition from physical death to life in heaven.  Isaiah 1169 (wolf shall dwell with lamb) is vision of new earth.  Isaiah 651725 refers to new heavens and earth.  Kingdom of God is both present and future. Present Matthew 1228 Luke 172021 Romans 1417 1 Corinthians 41920 Colossians 11314. Future 1 Corinthians 69 Gal 521 Ephesians 55 2 Tim 418.  Last days refers to entire era between Christs first and second coming. New Testament writers said they were already in last days (Acts 21617 1 Corinthians 1011 1 John 218) but a final last day is yet future (John 63940 44 54 1124 1248).  Old Testament prophecies about Israel in Canaan predicted eternal dwelling of all Gods people on new earth of which Canaan was a type (Hebrews 4 Gal 329).  Historic premil response to amil  Revelation 201 says angel came down from heaven and Revelation 204 refers to bodily resurrection so Revelation 2016 is on Earth.  Dispensational premil response to amil  Nothing in Revelation 2016 indicates shift from earth to heaven. Rev 510 also seems to argue for reigning on earth.  Postmil response to amil  Matthew 281820 (Great Commission) and Matthew 1618 teach Christianization of world before end.;Robert G. Clouse George Eldon Ladd Anthony A.

The book covers feeding digestion daily living traveling and health. Its published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  Breastfeeding   Wait until baby gets gist of breastfeeding before introducing artificial nipples (bottles or pacifiers). This may take 26 weeks.   Give Vitamin D drops (200 IUday) to exclusively breastfed babies starting at 2 months. Babies getting 16 oz formuladay dont need.  Formula   Cows milkbased formula is fine and cheapest soy is also OK and slightly more expensive. Elemental formula is reserved for those who cant drink others and is much more expensive.   Powder is cheapest.   Put powder in dry bottles then add room temperature or warm water prior to feeding.   Warming formula is unnecessary. If you do use bottle warmer or put bottles in saucepan of warm water. Dont microwave.   Leftover milk in bottles must be discarded after 1 hour.   Sterilize feeding supplies and pacifiers prior to first use by boiling for 5 minutes.   Between feedings wash feeding supplies in hot water or dishwasher.  Miscellaneous Feeding  For babies that spit up a lot hold or position them upright for 2030 minutes after feeding.  Sleeping   Alternate the direction the baby faces when sleeping to prevent head flattening.   Teach baby to sleep at night by having her sleep in lit and active rooms during the day and a dark quiet room at night.   You cant spoil a baby within the first several months so respond promptly to crying.  Diapering  Baby wipes are safe to use.  Bathing  Washing baby with water is fine but you can also use baby soap.  Car Seats   Children should remain in rearfacing seats as long as possible determined by seats upper weight limit or when top of childs head is within 1 inch of seats top.   Babys car seat should be at 45deg regardless of angle of seat in car.   Register car seat with manufacturer to be notified of recalls.   Use switchable retractor or locking latch plate to secure car seat.   Middle of back seat is safest but not all car seats work there. Next safest is passenger side back seat.   Have a certified technician check your seat. Find one at httpwww.nhtsa.gov or httpwww.safekids.org.

Im a Christian in the Reformed tradition so I felt was time I read Calvins classic work. I was mainly interested in his explanation of predestination (election and reprobation). I found other topics thoughtprovoking as well including the image of God free will original sin depravity church offices and baptism.  In most cases Calvin provides ample scriptural support for his stances. The work is wellorganized into books chapters and sections.  I didnt read the entire work I read only the topics that grabbed my attention usually because of my own questions or discussions with others. Following are my notes.  Introduction  For we know that in repeating the words of Scripture the apostles were often pretty free since they held it sufficient if they cited them in accordance with the matter for this reason they did not make the words a point of conscience.  Book 1  God in the OT  We believe neither by our own nor by anyone elses judgment that Scripture is from God but above human judgment we affirm with utter certainty ... that it has flowed to us from the very mouth of God by the ministry of men. We seek no proofs ... but we subject our judgment and wit to it as to a thing far beyond any guesswork ... we feel that the undoubted power of his divine majesty lives and breathes there.  Inasmuch as Moses published all these things before the congregation among eyewitnesses of the events what opportunity was there for fraud  Both his fatherly goodness and his beneficently inclined will are repeatedly extolled and examples of his severity are given which show him to be the righteous avenger of evil deeds especially where his forbearance toward the obstinate is of no effect.  ... God whose wisdom power and righteousness are incomprehensible sets before us Moses history as a mirror in which his living likeness glows. ... let us willingly remain enclosed within these bounds to which God has willed to confine us and as it were to open up our minds that they may not through their very freedom to wander go astray.  God did not spare those angels who sinned [2 Pet 24] and kept not their original nature but left their abode [Jude 6]. And Paul in speaking of the elect angels [1 Tim 521] is no doubt tacitly contrasting them with the reprobate angels.  Representations of God  ... You shall not make for yourself a graven image nor any likeness [Ex 204]. By these words he restrains our waywardness from trying to represent him by any visible image ... But God does not compare these images with one another as if one were more suitable another less so but without exception he repudiates all likenesses pictures and other signs by which the superstitious have thought he will be near them.  God speaks against all images (Ex 41516).  From this [Acts 1729] it is clear that every statue man erects or every image he paints to represent God simply displeases God as something dishonorable to his majesty.  God indeed from time to time showed the presence of his divine majesty by definite signs ... But all the signs that he ever gave forth aptly conformed to his plan of teaching and at the same time clearly told men of his incomprehensible essence. For clouds and smoke and flame [Deut 411] although they were symbols of heavenly glory restrained the minds of all ... from attempting to penetrate too deeply.  If it were not true that whatever knowledge of God is sought from images is fallacious and counterfeit the prophets would not so generally have condemned it.  Paul testifies that by the true preaching of the gospel Christ is depicted before our eyes as crucified [Gal 31]. ... From this one fact they could have learned more than from a thousand crosses of wood or stone.  The Lord forbade not only the erection of statues constructed to represent himself but also the consecration of any inscriptions and stones that would invite adoration [Ex 2025].  ... it seems to me unworthy of their holiness for them to take on images other than those living and symbolical ones which the Lord has consecrated by his Word. I mean Baptism and the Lords Supper ...  Human nature the image of God free will  ... even though we grant that Gods image was not totally annihilated and destroyed in him yet it was so corrupted that whatever remains is frightful deformity. Consequently the beginning of our recovery of salvation is in that restoration which we obtain through Christ who also is called the Second Adam for the reason that he restores us to true and complete integrity. ... the end of regeneration is that Christ should reform us to Gods image. [1 Cor 1545]  ... to begin with Gods image was visible in the light of the mind in the uprightness of the heart and in the soundness of all the parts.  Now Gods image is the perfect excellence of human nature which shone in Adam before his defection but was subsequently so vitiated and almost blotted out that nothing remains after the ruin except what is confused mutilated and diseaseridden. Therefore in some part it now is manifest in the elect in so far as they have been reborn in the spirit but it will attain its full splendor in heaven.  Providence  Verses that show that providence directs humans Lev 2634 Deut 111314 2812 Lev 2619 Deut 2822 Is 282 Haggai 218 Ps 1479 Ps 1469 Matt 1029 Ps 11356 Jer 1023 Prov 169 Ex 2113 Prov 1633 Prov 2913 222 Ps 7567.

God cant be blamed for sin  Verses that show that God is sovereign over Satan and wicked angels Job 16 21 121 1 Kings 2220 22.  Verses that show that God is sovereign over the wicked Acts 428 223 318 2 Sam 1622 1212 Jer 115 714 5025 259 276 Is 718 or 526 Hosea 81 Zephaniah 21 Is 105 Matt 310 Is 2821 2 Sam 1610 11 1 Kings 1131 1 Sam 234.  Verses that show that Gods impulse affects humans Prov 211 Ezekiel 726 Job 1224 Ps 10740 10640 Lev 2636 1 Sam 2612 Is 2914 Deut 2828 Zechariah 124 Is 2910 Rom 128 Ex 1417 Rom 12024 Ex 912 101 1020 27 1110 148 815 32 934 421 Joshua 1120 Deut 230 Ps 10525 Is 106 1 Sam 1614 2 Cor 44 2 Thess 211 Ezekiel 149 Rom 128 29.  ... when we do not grasp how God wills to take place what he forbids to be done let us recall our mental incapacity and at the same time consider that the light in which God dwells is not without reason called unapproachable [1 Tim 616] because it is overspread with darkness.  As Augustine said There is a great difference between what is fitting for man to will and what is fitting for God and to what end the will of each is directed so that it be either approved or disapproved. For through the bad wills of evil men God fulfills what he righteously wills.  His will is wrongly confused with his precept and in the same act as mans evil deed shows itself so Gods justice shines forth. Examples 2 Sam 161011 1 Kings 1123 1010.  As Augustine said ... God works even in evil mens hearts whatever he wills yet renders to them according to their deserts ...  In Judas betrayal it will be no more right because God himself both willed that his Son be delivered up and delivered him up to death to ascribe the guilt of the crime to God than to transfer the credit for redemption to Judas.  [Augustine] correctly points out elsewhere that in this examination God does not inquire into what men have been able to do or what they have done but what they have willed to do so that purpose and will may be taken into account.  Book 2  Original sin  All creatures says Paul are groaning [Rom 822] subject to corruption not of their own will [Rom 820].  Original sin is inherited Rom 512 17 19 Ps 515 Job 144 Eph 23.  For the contagion does not take its origin from the substance of the flesh or soul but because it had been so ordained by God that the first man should at one and the same time have and lose both for himself and for his descendants the gifts that God had bestowed upon him.  Infants ... are guilty not of anothers fault but of their own. For even though the fruits of their iniquity have not yet come forth they have the seed enclosed within them. Indeed their whole nature is a seed of sin hence it can be only hateful and abhorrent to God.  Original sin affects body mind and soul Rom 3 Eph 423 Rom 122 Rom 86 7.  Sinful nature  Nothing however slight can be credited to man without depriving God of his honor and without man himself falling into ruin through brazen confidence.  ... free will is not sufficient to enable man to do good works unless he be helped by grace indeed by special grace which only the elect receive through regeneration.  Other verses about our sinful nature 2 Cor 317 John 155 Is 402931 1 Cor 320.  Since Christ restores supernatural gifts (faith love of God charity toward neighbor holiness and righteousness) we infer that these were taken away in the Fall. Natural gifts (sound mind upright heart reason) were corrupted but a residue remains. John 145.  ... since man is by nature a social animal he tends through natural instinct to foster and preserve society. Consequently we observe that there exist in all mens minds universal impressions of a certain civic fair dealing and order. ... Hence arises that unvarying consent of all ... mortals with regard to laws. For their seeds have without teacher or lawgiver been implanted in all men.  The natural gifts exercised by both believers and unbelievers are from God. Art and science are natural gifts because all have them to some degree.  ... we see in this diversity [Gods general grace and natural gifts] some remaining traces of the image of God ...  Human nature cant know God without God working in the heart. John 113 Matt 1617 Tit 35 1 Cor 123 John 327 Deut 2934 Jer 247 John 644 1 Cor 113ff 1 Cor 214 Eph 117 18 1 Cor 320 Ps 9411 Gen 65 821.  Those who dont know the Law (in the Bible) are judged by natural law or conscience. Rom 21415.  Not all sins are caused by deliberate malice and depravity some are failures of good intentions.  Human will doesnt precede the Spirits grace. Phil 213 Ps 5110.  Verses about humanitys corrupt nature Rom 867 Eph 42223 1718 Jer 179 Ps 1413 5313 Rom 31018 23ff.  In his elect the Lord cures these diseases ... . Others he merely restrains ... inasmuch as he foresees their control to be expedient to preserve all that is. Hence some are restrained by shame from breaking out into many kinds of foulness others by the fear of the law ... Still others because they consider an honest manner of life profitable in some measure aspire to it. ... . Thus God by his providence bridles perversity of nature that it may not break forth into action but he does not purge it within.  ... however excellent anyone has been his own ambition always pushes him on  a blemish with which all virtues are so sullied that before God they lose all favor  anything in profane men that appears praiseworthy must be considered worthless. Besides where there is no zeal to glorify God the chief part of uprightness is absent a zeal of which all those whom he has not regenerated by his Spirit are devoid. As for the virtues that deceive us with their vain show ... before the heavenly judgment seat they shall be of no value to acquire righteousness.  Redemption is by God alone with no human help. Phil 16 Ezek 362627 Phil 1213 Eph 2010 20 Jer 3229 40 Ezek 1119 1 Kings 858 Ps 1193336 Is 5110 5012 John 1515 Ps 8611 John 644.  Example of God Satan and humans acting in the same event showing Gods sovereignty over all Job 11221.  How God works in human hearts  God hardens the hearts of the wicked. Is 610 Deut 230 Job 122024 Ezek 726 Ps 10740 Is 6317 Ex 734 421 101 20 27 1110 148 Ps 10525 2 Thess 21011.  Yet in the same work there is always a great difference between what the Lord does and what Satan and the wicked try to do. God makes these evil instruments which he holds under his hand and can turn wherever he pleases to serve his justice. They ... give birth to a wickedness conceived in their depraved nature. ... Satan reigns in a reprobate man and ... the Lord acts in both.  Gods dominion stands above our freedom. Examples Ex 1123 Ps 10646 1 Sam 116 2 Sam 1714 1 Kings 1210 14 Josh 29 Deut 2865 Lev 2636 Prov 211.  Free will  God rewards as if they were our own virtues those graces which he bestows upon us because he makes them ours. Rom 830 1 Cor 47.  God gives the elect the capacity to obey. John 155 1 Cor 38 1614 87 Rom 916 Is 524 245 Jer 913 1611 4410 Dan 911 Amos 24 Deut 1016 Jer 44 Ezek 111920 Jer 3133 Ezek 3626 Deut 306 Eph 610 2 Thess 111 2 Cor 816 John 1715 1 John 39 Tit 345.  Good works are called ours in the same way the daily bread we ask from God is called ours He gives them to us. (Matt 611).  The law  The law (except ceremonial law) is still in effect though in the NT we are free from the harsh and dangerous requirements including curses and death. Rom 76 Matt 51718 2 Tim 316017 Gal 45.  The ceremonial law is abrogated in use but not in effect. Col 21317 Luke 1616 John 117 Eph 21415.  Descendents are mentioned in 2nd commandment because idolatry often runs in families. God doesnt punish for ancestors sins but for each individuals sin. Ezek 1820.  Although the Sabbath (4th commandment) has been abrogated we still need a day to gather to hear the Word have the sacraments and have public prayer (Acts 242). We also need to give rest to workers (Deut 51415 Ex 2312). These apply to us as much as to the Jews.  We dont need to keep the Sabbath because Christ fulfilled it. Col 217 Gal 41011 Rom 145. Paul established Sunday meetings for the peace of Christian fellowship (1 Cor 162) not as Sabbath replacement.  Nor do I cling to the number seven so as to bind the church in subjection to it. And I shall not condemn Churches that have other solemn days for their meetings provided there be no superstition.  Misc.  That the testaments are different doesnt mean God is inconsistent just that he accommodated different ages and capacities. Its similar to how a farmer works differently in different seasons or a doctor treats a patient at different ages.  Christ preaching to the souls in prison (1 Pet 319) means that saved and unsaved souls were made aware of Christs death.  That Christ descended into hell (according to the Apostles Creed) means that He suffered the judgment and wrath of God that was due to us. He was punished in soul as well as body. Acts 224 Heb 57 Matt 2746 Is 535 Heb 215 1 Pet 322. This is supported by the fact that Christ feared more than just death (Luke 224344 Matt 2639).  Book 3  Predestination (election and reprobation)  Election isnt from foreknowledge of merit. Eph 149 2 Tim 19 Rom 911 John 151619 63745 179 138 Ex 3319.  The Bible clearly teaches reprobation and that God wills it. Rom 9 Matt 1513 Prov 164 Ex 916 1 Cor 12228.  The elect are called by grace. Rom 82930 John 64445 Ezek 1119 3626 Rom 9 Rom 14 Is 651 Acts 1348 Eph 14.  Election is irrevocable. John 63739 John 176 12 John 102729 Phil 16 1 John 219.  The reprobate cant believe even when preached to. Ex 421 Is 6910 Matt 131115 Mark 412 Luke 810 John 123940 Acts 282627 Rom 118.  Ezek 3311 I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live refers to the elect who alone can repent. 1 Tim 228 Jer 311819.  By announcing salvation to all men indiscriminately ... he merely means that his mercy is extended to all provided they seek after it and implore it. But only those whom he has illumined do this. And he illumines those whom he has predestined to salvation.  Therefore since Gods mercy is offered to both sorts of men [elect and reprobate] through the gospel it is faith ... that distinguishes between pious and impious so that the former feel the working of the gospel while the latter derive no profit from it.  God saves only some in the NT just as in the OT he saved only within Israel among all the nations.  Book 4  Church offices  Offices of apostles prophets evangelists (Eph 4) were temporary for establishing churches and transitioning churches into NT.  Teachers replaced prophets and pastors (AKA bishops presbyters ministers) replaced apostles and evangelists.  Offices of pastor and teacher are permanent. Teachers are in charge of scriptural interpretation (keeping doctrine whole and pure) but not discipline sacraments warnings. Pastors are in charge of all these.  There are 2 grades of deacon those who distribute alms and those who care for the poor (Rom 128). The latter is the only public office open to women (1 Tim 5910).  Fasting  Fasting isnt abolished in the NT Jesus supports it for times of calamity and mourning. Matt 915 Luke 53435.  When fasting we should eat common simple food and avoid delicacies. We should eat sparingly and lightly only for need.  Baptism  Baptism replaced circumcision. Both have the same promise (Gods favor forgiveness eternal life) and regeneration.  Jesus said that infants and children belong to the kingdom of heaven. Matt 191315 Luke 1815 Mark 1013. The Greek text refers to infants not only older children.  The NT doesnt record infant baptism but implies it when families are baptized. The purpose of baptism is just as appropriate for infants as adults.;John Calvin John Thomas McNeill Ford Lewis Battles

The story itself is decent theres a relatively suspenseful mix of religion culture politics and military action. Its not your stereotypically lifeless techheavy scifi. My problem was that Paul Jessica and the other characters are so different from me that I couldnt relate so I didnt care what happened to them. The book was interesting enough that I finished it but it wasnt so great that I wanted to race through it or get to the sequels.  The book follows the boy Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica from their homeworld to the desert planet of Arrakis. Despite their alien origins they assimilate to Arrakis culture and begin to discover the secrets of its spice and sandworms. The story spans years as Paul struggles to uncover and understand his ancestry prescient powers destiny and potential demise.  The plot twists and turns as Paul and Jessica of the noble House Atreides deal with the rival House Harkonnen. Both houses question the allegiance and motives of those they encounter always watching for treacherous backstabbers. Some of the prominent characters suffer surprise deaths a welcome feature since protagonists and their allies are invulnerable in so many popular books.  I was struck by the broad vocabulary and detailed descriptions. I listened to the audiobook but I could see the scenes in my mind like I was watching a movie. I even became thirsty hearing about the arid scarcity of the Arrakis and the severe scarcity of water. The cultures are wellfleshedout especially the Fremen.  I listened to the unabridged audiobook from BBC Audiobooks America which had an excellent vocal cast As a Star Wars fan I recognized the influence of this book on George Lucas films including the desert planet the giant worms the desert dwellers the mystical powers held by a secretive elite class.;Frank Herbert

Part 1 explains the origin and history of Reformed theology (Calvinism). Part 2 explains the basic doctrines of Reformed theology centered around the Five Points (TULIP). It quotes the Bible and Westminster Confession heavily. Much of the content in Part 2 is similar to another of Sprouls books Chosen by God. That book has better explanations though a narrower scope. This book complements it well. Notes follow.  Foundations of Reformed Theology  If God never violates human freedom it is not because of any limit on his sovereignty. It is because he sovereignly decrees not to.  Christ fulfilled the law for me and gained the merit necessary for my justification. This is the ground not only of my justification but also of my assurance of salvation.  When James 224 says a man is justified by works it means true faith manifests itself in (produces) good works. The verser appeals to Gen 22 when Abraham showed he had true faith just justifying his claim to faith. This use of justification is different than in Rom 32728 which appeal to Gen 15 where God counted Abraham righteous the moment be believed before performing any works of obedience.  When we say were justified by works by refers to the works of Christ the cause of our justification. We are justified by faith in the works performed on our behalf by Christ.  Gods first covenant with humanity was the covenant of works. THe penalty for violation was death (not limited to spiritual death) on the day the sin occurred. That Adam and Eve didnt physically die on the day of their first sin was due to Gods mercy and grace.  Originally all sin was a capital offense so the OT penal code was actually quite merciful.  The covenant of grace doesnt destroy the covenant of works it makes it possible for the covenant of works to be fulfilled.  Humanitys Radical Corruption (Total Depravity)  Rom 3918 71519 Eph 215 John 66368  We cant convert ourselves or even prepare for conversion because we have no desire for the righteousness of God and free choice by definition involves choosing what we desire.  Calvin man is said to have a free will not because he has a free choice of good and evil but because he acts voluntarily and not by compulsion. ... man is not forced to be the servant of sin while he is however ... (a voluntary slave) his will being bound by the fetters of sin.  A person who is inclined in only one direction whether to the good or to the evil is still free in a certain sense. This freedom is real. For example God is totally free yet he is morally unable to sin. ... This lack of desire for evil does not diminish Gods freedom. Likewise in heaven we will still be free to choose what we want but we will choose only the good because this is the only thing we will desire.  Gods Sovereign Choice (Unconditional Election)  Eph 1312 2810 Rom 82930 91016 John 64344 6468  Election refers to Gods active intervention in the lives of the elect to work faith in their hearts. [Reprobation] refers not to Gods working unbelief in the hearts of the reprobate but simply to his passing by them and withholding his regenerating grace from them.  Gods hatred for the reprobate is different than human hatred. Its divine holy not malicious it withholds favor.  Christs Purposeful Atonement (Limited Atonement)  John 17612  In John 212 our likely refers to Jewish believers so whole world refers to Gentile believers.  John 63739 shows that Christs work of saving the elect is certain its not a mere possibility of salvation for all.  The Spirits Effective Call (Irresistible Grace)  Regeneration precedes faith because its a necessary condition for faith. The order of salvation (Rom 82930) refers to a logical order not necessarily a temporal order. We say faith precedes justification because justification is logically dependent on faith not faith on justification. We are justified because we have faith. At the moment faith is present justification occurs. Regeneration precedes faith because we cant exercise saving faith until were regenerated.  Gods Preservation of the Saints (Perseverance of the Saints)  Matt 2413 2 Pet 11012 1 John 21925 Phil 136 Rom 83136  Sometimes Scripture seems to forbid the impossible and command the impossible (e.g. Matt 548). Its in this way Scripture warns the elect not to fall away. By calling us to the highest standards it drives us to depend on grace.  Heb 646 speaks of regenerated Christians because it says theyve repented and only regenerated Christians truly repent. These verses may be an argument rather than a genuine warning they may be an ad hominem argument taking the other partys view to its absurd logical end (such as 1 Cor 1517). Heb 6912 supports this interpretation because it shows confidence that the elect will do the things accomplishing salvation.;R.C. Sproul

Maybe Ive been spoiled by J.R.R. Tolkien but I wasnt overly impressed with this book and never felt compelled to keep reading it. However I reserve final judgment until after I finish the series (5 books total).  The tale is told from the viewpoint of 8 characters from various realms of the Seven Kingdoms each chapter is spent with one of these characters. At the beginning of the book each characters story begins separately and at a slow pace but the stories accelerate and intertwine as the book progresses. Many chapters end with cliffhangers that are picked up when you cycle back to that character several chapters later.  Unlike The Lord of the Rings where there are long dialogues to explain the backstory Martin reveals information on a needtoknow basis characters often drop hints or make revelations at the ends of chapters. Theres a map to help find and remember locations and several pages of the characters houses (families) in the appendix. I didnt find these houses right away so I spent the first quarter of the book struggling to remember the multitude of characters and their titles nicknames and relationships.  My favorite characters were Eddard Stark and Jon Snow. My least favorite was Daenerys Stormborn.  The book has a feeling of medieval ancientry to it you get a glimpse into thousands of years of history. You experience the various cultures of the Seven Kingdoms with their customs attire weaponry and buildings. There are definitely worse fantasy books out there but there are certainly better ones as well.;George R.R. Martin

Its a mix of theory application and examples. The advice is realistic it says to be optimistic but aware of your limits. As a freelance web designer (OptimWise) I negotiate in sales and client relations. Ive seen this book mentioned in magazines like Inc. and Entrepreneur and a few business and sales books. I finally decided to read it when it was recommended on This Week in Web Design.  Main ideas   Understand empathetically their point of view.   Explain your interests and reasoning before presenting your proposal. Otherwise they may not listen to your reasoning.   Never yield to pressure only to principle.   Expand the pie dont simply divide it. Aim for mutual gain.   Negotiate to strengthen the relationship not strain it.  Separate the People from the Problem   Dont blame.   Involve them in the decisionmaking process.   Talk about both sides emotions.   An apology defuses emotions even if you dont take personal responsibility for the situation.   Describe how the problem affects you rather than accusing them.   Sit and act sidebyside not facetoface.  Focus on Interests Not Positions   Show that you understand their interests.   Dont argue about the past decide on the future.  Invent Options for Mutual Gain   Shrink the scope of a proposal to reduce perceived risk offer a trial phase.   Offers are usually more effective than threats.  Insist on Using Objective Criteria   Frame each issue as a joint search for objective criteria. Ask Whats your theory or how did you arrive at that proposal   Agree on standards before negotiating.   Go to a third party if necessary.  Develop Your BATNA   Your BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement) helps determine the minimally acceptable agreement and will likely raise that minimum.  Negotiation Ninjitsu   Invite criticism about your proposal ask what theyd do in your situation.   Use questions not statements.   Be silent after they give an unsatisfactory answer theyll feel compelled to reanswer.   Say please correct me if Im wrong to appear open to correction.   Express gratitude for what theyve done so far. Say I appreciate what youve done.   Its not a question of trust its a question of principle.   Give a credible reason for taking a break from negotiating such as talking it over with another.  Taming the Hard Bargainer   When someone uses their hardhearted partner as an excuse first get their commitment in writing then ask to speak to the partner.  Ten Questions People Ask   Negotiating doesnt require compromising your principles. Find a solution consistent with both sides principles.   Propose your opening figure as a suggestion based on objective standards not a firm position.   The more you try for the more youre likely to get.;Roger Fisher William Ury Bruce Patton

Pollan proposes a new answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. Pollans bracing and eloquent manifesto shows us how we can start making thoughtful food choices that will enrich our lives enlarge our sense of what it means to be healthy and bring pleasure back to eating.;205;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;In Defense of Food An Eaters Manifesto;nonfiction;Pollan exposes the inadequacy of Western nutrition science and the detrimental effects of industrial food on our health. He argues that nutritionists have tried reducing diets to their component foods and reducing foods to their component chemicals. But diets and foods are greater than the sum of their parts. Pollan proposes a return to the traditional holistic view of food and its ecological and cultural elements. I didnt agree with everything Pollan recommends but he presents thoughtprovoking data and advice regarding Western eating habits.  Pollan decries nutritionism the scientific paradigm that has promoted industrial food and the Western diet. He shows that nutrition science is a very immature field with a limited understanding of nutrition which has led it to change its recommendations every few years (avoid fats avoid carbs etc.). Despite its supposedly scientific basis the Western diet has caused increases in the Western diseases such as obesity heart disease diabetes and certain cancers.  Plants and animals have been bred to produce greater quantities of food at the expense of their quality modern industrial foods have lower nutritional value than their traditionally produced counterparts. Leaves have been replaced with seeds and grains (such as corn soy and wheat) and are usually heavily processed. The food industry pushes refined and processed foods because theyre more profitable regardless of their nutritional value.  Pollan explains that humans can and have for thousands of years lived healthy lives on a wide range of traditional diets without nutritionism. Nutritionists try to extract the magic food from traditional diets (wine olive oil fish etc.) and the magic nutrients from foods (resveratrol omega3 etc.). What they fail to realize is that the foods in diets are synergistic as are the nutrients within foods. They also ignore the social and cultural components of diets.  Consider the French Paradox. Although their diet contains a lot of saturated fat the French have relatively low rates of obesity and heart disease. Pollan argues that this isnt likely due to any particular food or nutrient but a combination of the synergies between the foods they eat and their lifestyle smaller portions slower eating and more exercise than Americans.  As an alternative to industrial food Pollan suggests a return to slow food where people are conscious of the ecological and social frameworks behind their food. He says people should prepare and eat food slowly and deliberately savoring it rather than viewing it as fuel to be scarfed down.  I guess Ive been indoctrinated by nutritionism because I love reading books and articles about dietary science and tweaking my diet to make sure I have the right proportions of the socalled food groups and nutrients. So I didnt enjoy this book as much as I would have if it had contained more prescriptive dietary advice. Its difficult for me to live by Pollans advice to eat a variety of whole real unprocessed foods and mostly ignore nutritionists.  Pollan says people should cook and grow their own food as much as possible. I do cook at home a lot (as much for my budget as for my health) but I dont grow my own food at all. I believe that society functions most efficiently when people are specialized so Id rather focus on improving my technical and business skills and pay someone else to grow my food. This is fine in theory but as this book shows its led to the unhealthy industrialization of food. Ill continue to get my food from both local gardeners and supermarkets but Ill try to be more conscious about selecting whole real foods and not falling for the health claims on industrial foods.  The book ends with Pollans food rules. I wrote about these in my review of Pollans Food Rules. The three main rules are 1) Eat food 2) Not too much and 3) Mostly plants. Theyre presented in expanded form in this book.;Michael Pollan
1036;324985;2;50548;0684823837;Why must humanity sufferC.S. Lewis the master apologist tackles the question that has plagued humanity for centuries. If God is both omnipotent and good how can we explain the pain and suffering that people experience daily And what of the suffering of animals who neither deserve pain nor can be improved by it With compassion and insight C.S. Lewis proposes reasonable answers to these critical theological problems sharing his wisdom with those who seek true understanding.;144;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Problem of Pain;nonfiction;Lewis addresses the problem of pain which he describes in this way If God were good He would make His creatures perfectly happy and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness or power or both.  As a Christian Ive often wondered about this issue especially when friends are diagnosed with cancer or the country suffers terrorist attacks. Its a difficult question and although I accept the explanation through faith grasping it rationally is another matter. Lewis does a good job dealing with the matter from both perspectives. However I doubt many nonJudeoChristians would be persuaded by this book. Lewis wouldnt be entirely at fault for that.  The main place where I disagree with Lewis is on the Creation and Fall of man. He rejects a literal interpretation of Genesis including a 6day creation Garden of Eden Adam and Eve forbidden fruit and temptation by Satan. Instead Lewis believes that humans evolved from apes or more primitive life forms and that the Genesis account is a myth. I was surprised by this because he references creation accounts and Adam and Eve in other works like The Chronicles of Narnia and Perelandra from his Space Trilogy. Perhaps he considers them all equally fictional stories.  The other reason I find Lewis rejection of a literal interpretation of Genesis surprising is that it causes many inconsistencies in the Bible. Both the Old and New Testaments contain references to the 6day creation and the Fall and how the Fall affected not only humanity but the rest of the planet as well. Jesus Himself talks about such issues. Lewis accepts the modern scientific view that pain and suffering existed on Earth for millennia before humans appeared. So much for God saw that it was good.  Despite such disagreements I thought Lewis presented a thoughtprovoking case for why God allows pain to exist. My favorite reason presented is that pain distracts us from our comfortable lives where were all too eager to forget about faith and God and forces us to become closer to Him and other Christians.  Notes  When we say God is omnipotent (allpowerful) we mean He can do anything thats intrinsically possible. Its nonsense to claim He can do whats intrinsically impossible or selfcontradictory.  The possibility of suffering is required by nature and free wills. To exclude it is to exclude life itself.  We were not made primarily to love God but for God to love us. 1 John 410.  Because God has and is all He only loves us and is grieved by us because He chooses to.  We sin not because of ignorance or inability but because we arent truly intending to avoid it.  Lewis rejects Total Depravity because logically we wouldnt know our depravity if we were totally depraved and because he sees so much goodness in human nature.  The question Was it better for God to create than to not create is meaningless because the reality that allows us to even pose the question requires that God did create. If the question did have any meaning the answer must be yes simply because God did create.  Lewis believes that humans descended from animals and that God granted them consciousness once they were sufficiently advanced. The Fall was an act of selfwill or selfinterest (and thus rebellion against God) exhibited by these early humans.  The Fall didnt surprise God. God saw the crucifixion in the act of creating the first nebula.  Lewis theory for the origin of disease and death Before the Fall God ruled the human organism through the human spirit.When man rejected God the human spirit lost control of the human organism and biochemical and environmental forces brought pain senility and death.  Lewis rejects the notion that we inherit Original Sin or moral responsibility from Adam (or some other remote ancestor). He says were members of a spoiled species by our own will and actions.  If the omniscient (allknowing) God knew that Abraham would obey him why the needless torture of testing his willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac Because even what God foreseespredestines hasnt actually occurred until the human performs it.  God uses tribulation to take our attention off our lives and toys and forces us to focus on Him. Thus tribulation must continue until we are remade (or our remaking is hopeless in the case the unsaved).  Because tribulation is necessary for redemption no economic or political reform can bring about heaven on earth. However we must still attempt to remove the evils of this world simply do to a strong sense of common miseries.  You will certainly carry out Gods purpose however you act but it makes a difference to you whether you serve like Judas or like John.  People go to Hell because they chose to. They exercise their free will to reject God. The doors of hell are locked on the inside.  You cant expect God to do more to help humans avoid Hell than he already has by dying on the cross at Calvary.  Lewis believes that nonhuman (plant animal etc.) life was corrupted by Satan or some other nonhuman entity before humans existed. Carnivorousness and animal suffering existed prior to humans.  Animals and plants cant truly suffer because they arent sentient.  God created individuals so he could love each differently and that each could love and worship Him differently.  Heaven isnt a bribe. There are rewards that do not sully motives. It is safe to tell the pure in heart that they shall see God for only the pure in heart want to.;C.S. Lewis

Once the most powerful Knight ever known to the Jedi Order he is now a disciple of the dark side a lord of the dreaded Sith and the avenging right hand of the galaxy s ruthless new Emperor. Seduced deranged and destroyed by the machinations of the Dark Lord Sidious Anakin Skywalker is dead . . . and Darth Vader lives.Word of the events that created him the Jedi Council s failed mutiny against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine the selfcrowned Emperor s retaliatory command to exterminate the Jedi Order and Anakin s massacre of his comrades and Masters in the Jedi Temple has yet to reach all quarters.

The deadliest threat rests in the hideously swift and lethal crimson lightsaber of Darth Vader behind whose brooding mask lies a shattered heart a poisoned soul and a cunning twisted mind hellbent on vengeance.For the handful of scattered Jedi survival is imperative if the light side of the Force is to be protected and the galaxy somehow someday reclaimed. Yet more important still is the wellbeing of the twin infants Leia and Luke Skywalker the children of Anakin and his doomed bride Padme Amidala. Separated after Padme s death they must be made safe at all costs lest the hope they represent for the future be turned to horror by the new Sith regime and the unspeakable power of the dark side.

It adds almost nothing to the Star Wars saga and with the exception of a few pages tells the story of a group of Jedi Id never heard of. The character development is so poor that I could barely keep track of who was who and I certainly didnt care about them. After reading Star Wars Episode III  Revenge of the Sith and its prequel Star Wars Labyrinth of Evil I figured I had to finish with this one. I regret it  It starts with a small group of Jedi who survive Order 66 the order Palpatine issued to the clones to turn on the Jedi. The story follows these Jedi as they attempt to stay one step ahead of the new Empire and Darth Vader. The only reason I picked up this book was to read about Luke and ObiWan on Tatooine Leia on Alderaan and Yoda on Dagobah. Unfortunately Luke and Leia are only mentioned in a few pages ObiWan only appears in the last chapter and Yoda doesnt appear at all.  There are a few redeeming parts theres some insight into the relationship between Palpatine and AnakinturnedVader as well as some of their private thoughts. It describes Vaders misery at being trapped in his lifesupport suit his growing hatred toward the Jedi and his wish to gain an apprentice who will help him overthrow Emperor Palpatine and seize the throne. SidiousPalpatine reflects on how he manipulated Anakin and how he plans to establish an Empire that will reign for a thousand years.  We meet or catch up with a few characters from the original trilogy. Wilhuff Tarkin is introduced as an ambitious young Moff. We meet Chewbacca as he escapes from an assaulted Kashyyyk. Mon Mothma and Bail Organa debate how to resist the Empire. In the last chapter ObiWan discovers that Anakin who he had left for dead has become Vader. He communicates with QuiGon through the Force and determines to remain on Tatooine watching over Luke and his foster parents Owen and Beru.  I can only recommend this for the most diehard of Star Wars fans. All others should run and dont look back. I wish I had.;James Luceno

In the Shadow Series and in this book in particular the story isnt as engaging and I didnt care much about the main or peripheral characters.  This book concludes the political maneuvering and military clashes that take place on Earth after the Battle School kids return. I found the endless narration of distant impersonal politics and skirmishes boring I would have preferred more time devoted to showing the Battle School grads in action closer up.  Colonel Graff and Mazer Rackham have an insightful conversation with Peter in chapter 20. Heres an excerpt  We want you to win so that the human race can stop spending its vast surpluses on ways to kill each other and can instead send all the people that would have been killed in war out into space. And all the money that would have been spent on weapons can be spent on colony ships and on trading ships eventually. The human race has always produced a vast surplus of human beings and of wealth and it has used up almost all of it either on stupid monuments like the pyramids or on brutal bloody pointless wars. We want you to unite the world so that this waste can finally stop.Its much easier to sympathize with the Peter of this series than the Peter presented in Enders Saga hes practically a different person and much more likable. The end of this book ties into Enders Saga Peter finally speaks to Valentine and Ender and you learn about the writing of The Hive Queen and The Hegemon.

The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Enders two older siblings Peter and Valentine are every bit as unusual as he is but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the militarys purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process to become a ruler.

I like the conversations at the beginning of each chapter which lend insight into the people and events behind the scenes of Enders life such as Graff and the other Battle School administrators working to shape Ender. I also like the sections where Peter and Valentine scheme competitively yet cooperatively.  The book stands alone but is even better when followed by Speaker for the Dead (my review) Xenocide (my review) and Children of the Mind (my review). I reread Enders Game after finishing those books and the Enders Shadow series (my review) which adds a lot to the characters of Bean Valentine Peter and the Wiggin parents.

Child follows your example dont model anger.   Habitually disciplining while angry. Child perceives discipline as personal vindictive attack. Discipline based on childs sin against God not trouble they caused you.   Scolding. Speak with selfcontrol with few words calmly gently.   Inconsistent discipline. Both parents must use same standards and each parent must be consistent from one incident to the next.   Having double standards. Live by the same standards you hold child to dont be hypocrite.   Not admitting youre wrong and not asking for forgiveness. When you offend your child admit it to them and ask for forgiveness.   Constantly finding fault. Praise with greater frequency than you reprove.   Not praising or encouraging. Regularly praise so child perceives correction as part of biblical love.   Unrealistic expectations. Remember that children think and act as children.  Angry Attitudes  Parent and child must be biblical in all 3 aspects of communication words tone of voice nonverbal communication.  Discipline What It Really Means  Gumnazo Principle biblical discipline involves correcting wrong behavior by practicing right behavior with right attitude for right reason until it becomes habitual. Think of a master teaching an apprentice through handson mentorship.  Anger Journal  1. What happened to provoke me to anger  2. What did I dosay when I became angry  3.

Disrespect and Manipulation  Respond to disrespect and manipulation with 1) appeal to personal responsibility and 2) appeal to Gods will.  Think Room  Think Room place in home for child to study for 515 minutes how to respond to parents in biblical manner.  Sending child to Think Room  Tell child  1. Time (usually 515 minutes)  2. Purpose (e.g. Youre being disrespectful. Figure out a more respectful way to respond)  3. Assignment (e.g. Be prepared to ask for my forgiveness and demonstrate at least 2 biblically better ways to respectfully make your point.  Think Room can be used before chastisement (preventive) or after.  Appeal Process  1. Child acknowledges your instruction  2. Child requests appeal  3.

It reads like a textbook and is quite impersonal which is a shame because author Jennifer Niederst Robbins has been designing since 1993 and obviously has a lot of experience to share. The book was published in June 2007 so it teaches HTML 4.01XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1 and is somewhat dated. Even so its a great introduction to web design principles HTML and CSS.  Each chapter includes several exercises and ends with a test which I found very helpful for gauging my understanding. The book concentrates on HTML and CSS and doesnt touch scripting but there are two chapters on graphics and many tips for other areas of web design.  Notes  HTML  Put decorative images in CSS not HTML.  POST hides submitted data and has no character limit. GET appends form data to the URL enabling bookmarking but has a 256 character limit.  Put form controls in lists ordered lists if order matters otherwise unordered .  CSS  Use ems or percentages for font sizes.  Use whitespace pre to preserve character spaces.  Use ems or pixels for box model measurements (content padding border margin).  Use visibility hidden to hide an element but hold its space blank and display none to hide an element and close the space it would have occupied.  Regardless of layout try to put the main content above extras in the source markup. Positionbased layouts are better for this since floatbased layouts require elements to be marked up in the order in which theyre laid out.  Web graphics  Use GIF or PNG for graphics with flat colors and hard edges. Use PNG for alpha transparency. Use JPG for photos or graduated color.;Jennifer Niederst Robbins

The 37 Signals authors make many similar points in Rework.  You can download the book for free.  Introduction  Months of planning are not necessary. Months of writing specs are not necessary  specs should have the foundations nailed and details figured out and refined during the development phase. Dont try to close all open issues and nail every single detail before development starts.  Fix Time and Budget Flex Scope  Heres an easy way to launch on time and on budget keep them fixed. Never throw more time or money at a problem just scale back the scope.  Its a Problem When Its a Problem   People often spend too much time up front trying to solve problems they dont even have yet.   Dont sweat stuff until you actually must. Dont overbuild.   Make decisions just in time when you have access to the real information you need. In the meanwhile youll be able to lavish attention on the things that require immediate care.  It Just Doesnt Matter   The best designers and the best programmers arent the ones with the best skills... they are the ones that can determine what just doesnt matter. Thats where the real gains are made.   Most of the time you spend is wasted on things that just dont matter. If you can cut out the work and thinking that just dont matter youll achieve productivity youve never imagined.  From Idea to Implementation  Go from brainstorm to sketches to HTML to coding.  1. Brainstorm What does the app need to do How will we know when its useful What exactly are we going to make  2. Sketches Draw stuff. Scrawl stuff. Boxes circles lines. Get your ideas out of your head and onto paper. The goal at this point should be to convert concepts into rough interface designs.  3. HTML Get something real posted so everyone can see what it looks like on screen. Dont write any programming code yet. Just build a mockup in HTML and CSS.  4. Code When the mockup looks good and demonstrates enough of the necessary functionality go ahead and plug in the programming code.  Shrink Your Time   Estimates that stretch into weeks or months are fantasies.   Keep breaking down timeframes into smaller chunks. Instead of a 12 week project think of it as 12 weeklong projects. Instead of guesstimating at tasks that take 30 hours break them down into more realistic 610 hour chunks. Then proceed one step at a time.   Smaller tasks and smaller timelines are more manageable hide fewer possible requirement misunderstandings and cost less to change your mind about or re do. Smaller timelines keep developers engaged...   Next time someone tries to pin you down for an exact answer to an unknowable question  whether its for a deadline date a final project cost... say I dont know... [Reframe] the question as a collaborative conversation. By learning how exact your estimate needs to be (and why) you can work together.  Hire Less and Hire Later   Dont hire people. Look for another way. Is the work thats burdening you really necessary What if you just dont do it Can you solve the problem with a slice of software or a change of practice instead   If theres no other way then consider a hire. But you should know exactly who to get how to introduce them to the work and the exact pain you expect them to relieve.  Get Well Rounded Individuals   Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists.   Small teams need people who can wear different hats.  Wordsmiths   If you are trying to decide between... people to fill a position always hire the better writer.   Being a good writer is about more than words. Good writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone elses shoes. They know what to omit. They think clearly.  Theres Nothing Functional about a Functional Spec   Functional specs force you to make the most important decisions when you have the least information.   The more you build it the more you use it the more you know it. Thats when you should be making decisions  when you have more information not less.   Functional specs dont let you evolve change and reassess.   Go with a briefer alternative that moves you toward something real. Write a one page story about what the app needs to do. Use plain language and make it quick. If it takes more than a page to explain it then its too complex. Then proceed as described in From Idea to Implementation.  Misc.   Make half the day alone time. Avoid communication and just work.   Build dont write. If you need to explain something try mocking it up and prototyping it rather than writing a long winded document.   Avoid building walls between your customers and the developmentdesign team. Dont outsource customer support to a call center or third party. Do it yourself. You and your whole team should know what your customers are saying.   Prioritize your bugs. Most bugs are annoying not destroying. Annoyances can be tabled for a bit.;37 Signals

It adds a lot of detail about the International Fleet (IF) Battle School and political climate on Earth that were missing from Enders Game but it doesnt match the emotion and element of surprise in Enders Game. I recommend it to fans of Enders Game but others wont likely enjoy it.  Enders Game is one of my favorite books and I really liked its sequel trilogy (Speaker for the Dead Xenocide and Children of the Mind). This book is the first in the Shadow Series and follows Bean not Ender during the events of Enders Game.  It starts with a starving orphaned nameless Bean on the streets of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. He forges alliances and civilizes the underground orphans thanks to his superhuman intellect and cunning but realizes that he lacks human emotions. Beans internal tug of war between his intellect and his attempts to unearth his emotions play out during his stay with the nun Sister Carlotta and his time at the Battle School.  In the Battle School Bean hears about the legendary Ender Wiggin and strives to earn his respect and eventually friendship. I was disappointed by how little time Ender got in this book Card must figure that readers have already had their fill with his other books. In fact most of this book assumes youre already very familiar with Enders Game and hardly devotes any time to explaining the Battle School or developing many of the characters.  The best developed characters are Bean Graff and Sister Carlotta. I liked the additional fleshing out of Graffs character as he works with the staff of the Battle School to test Ender and Bean and argues with Sister Carlotta about Beans origin and destiny. We revisit Sister Carlotta every few chapters as she searches for the secret of Beans origin and intelligence.  Beans supernatural intelligence plays a major role in the story. It allows him to derive the secrets of the Battle School and IF leading him to discover the earthshattering secret behind Enders Game. This is my main complaint about the book I loved Enders Game for the twists and surprises and in this book Bean always seemed a step ahead figuring things out and expecting the unexpected. The reader is passive watching Bean unravel mysteries from a distance whereas in Enders Game the reader lives each day alongside Ender learning as he does.  Fans of Enders Game will enjoy the additional perspective and cameos by many characters. Also the book has a great ending that brings it full circle. I plan to read the rest of the Shadow Series to see where Bean goes from here.;Orson Scott Card

Not all the chapters deal directly with creation or evolution some are about biblical historicity theological implications and proper translation of Hebrew texts. I dont think it would be convincing to nonChristians even though it sometimes uses logical and scientific arguments its full of Bible verses and relies heavily on traditional Christian beliefs.  Despite its title the book often responds to a question with more than one biblically and scientifically acceptable hypothesis not an absolute answer. Its written for common readers not scientists but the footnotes contain references to scientific papers and books. I wanted more scientific details but it provides a good introduction to the topics that spark interest in further reading. Im neither a scientist nor a theologian but as far as I can tell the book is scientifically and theologically sound. Of course Ill continue studying alternative perspectives on these topics. My favorite chapters were those on carbon14 dating radiometric dating distant starlight the origins of defenseattack structures and archaeological support for the Bible.  There are a few recurring themes. One is that theres a difference between historical science and observational science. Another is that all scientists are inevitably biased by their preexisting assumptions about origins (cosmological geological biological etc.) and the rates of natural processes. Another also concerned with biases is that Christians often rely on eisegesis (interpreting the Bible according to preexisting ideas) rather than exegesis (interpreting the Bible critically based on the text). Another is that there are serious theological implications to denying the truth of select parts of the Bible (e.g. if some parts arent true maybe others arent).  Some of the illustrations were helpful but but most were too cartoony and made the book seem juvenile. I had already read most of this book in article form on the Answers in Genesis website. In fact you can read the entire book online.  Notes  Quotations in notes below are directly from the book.  Natural selection and mutations  Antibiotics are natural products produced by fungi and bacteria and modern antibiotics are typically derivatives of those. So its natural that some bacteria are resistant to certain antibiotics. Bacteria can gain resistance by losing genetic information andor swapping DNA with resistant bacteria. Neither produce a net gain of genetic information. See Antibiotic Resistance of Bacteria An Example of Evolution in Action  Carbon14 dating and radiometric dating  Carbon14 dating assumes the atmospheric ratio of C14 to C12 has remained constant. However it could have changed due to the Earths weakening magnetic field andor the Flood burying large amounts of carbon. See Doesnt Carbon14 Dating Disprove the Bible  Radiometric dating assumes radioactive decay rates are constant. However nuclear decay has been shown to have occurred at grossly accelerated rates when molten rocks were forming crystallizing and cooling. Also decay rates may have been greatly accelerated in the past the RATE group suggests this occurred early in the creation week and again during the Flood. See Does Radiometric Dating Prove the Earth Is Old  Ice cores  See Ice Cores and the Age of the Earth.  Distant starlight  The best explanation for distant starlight is that God used a supernatural act to bring distant starlight to Earth just as He created the universe supernaturally. Perhaps Earth was once in a gravitational well causing time to flow more slowly here than elsewhere in the universe. Perhaps the Bible uses cosmic local time rather than universal time. Alternative explanations such as God creating beams of light intransit or the speed of light being variable have problems. See Does Distant Starlight Prove the Universe Is Old  Homologous biological structures  Structures that appear homologous often develop under the control of genes that are not homologous. See Hasnt Evolution Been Proven True  Jesus believed in the historicity of Creation and Old Testament miracles  Jesus didnt allegorize Creation and other Old Testament miracles but treated them as historical accounts (e.g. creation of Adam Noah and the Flood Lot in Sodom Moses and the manna Jonah in the fish or whale). See Matthew 1015 Matthew 124041 Matthew 1519 Matthew 1936 Matthew 243839 Mark 1039 Mark 1319 Luke 42527 Luke 115051 Luke 172832 John 314 John 54547 John 63233  49. See Did Jesus Say He Created in Six Literal Days  Other verses that teach creation Exodus 2011 Psalm 336  9 Colossians 11617 John 113.  Jesus and Peter believed in a historical Noahs Flood. See Matthew 243739 2 Peter 337.  Death prior to the Fall  Millions of years of biological evolution prior to homo sapiens is incompatible with the Bible which teaches that the death of animals and humans is a result of the Fall. See Romans 512 1 Corinthians 154549. Genesis 12930 teaches that animals and humans were originally vegetarian. The Bible speaks of animals and humans having or being nephesh (Hebrew) or soullife in various contexts suggesting conscious life. The Hebrew phrase nephesh chayyah literally means in which there is life and is used in Genesis 12021 and Genesis 27 to refer to humans and animals. ...this phrase is never used in reference to plants (or invertebrates) thus highlighting the difference between plant life and human and animal life. Plants do not possess this nephesh quality and so cannot die in the scriptural sense. See Why Does Gods Creation Include Death and Suffering  The Bible and science  Gods Word must be the final authority on all matters about which it speaks  not just the moral and spiritual matters but also its teachings that bear on history archaeology and science. What is at stake here is the authority of Scripture the character of God the doctrine of death and the very foundation of the gospel. If the early chapters of Genesis are not true literal history then faith in the rest of the Bible is undermined including its teaching about salvation and morality.  The Bible isnt a science textbook but it can be relied upon when it touches on every scientific issue including ecology. It is the Bible that gives us the big picture. Within this big picture we can build scientific models that help us explain how past events may have come about.  We cannot assume that past acts of God are necessarily understandable in terms of a current scientific mechanism because science can only probe the way in which God sustains the universe today. It is irrational to argue that a supernatural act cannot be true on the basis that it cannot be explained by natural processes observed today.;Ken Ham David Menton Georgia Purdom Tommy Mitchell Jason Lisle Terry Mortenson Monty White Paul Taylor

It explains the principles and practices of using biblical parenting to address a childs internal character rather than simply external behavior. I like that Tripps parenting style is based on the Bible but Im undecided about some of the specifics (related to spanking).  The biblical approach to parenting (based on Proverbs 23 and other passages)  1. Rich full communication  2. Spanking  Spanking underscores the importance of the communication.  I read this because it was recommended by several Christian parents.  Notes  Children generally do not resist authority that is truly kind and selfless.  Two issues feed into the people children become  1. Shaping influences family life values roles history etc.  2. Godward orientation whether they worship God or idols.  Secular parenting versus biblical parenting  Children dont need to make decisions to learn to be decision makers. Children will be good decision makers as they observe faithful parents modeling and instructing wise direction and decision making on their behalf.  The Bible teaches to esteem others not to develop strong selfesteem.  The Bible doesnt teach to fight back or ignore bullies. It teaches to overcome evil with good leave vengeance to God love and bless enemies and to make peace.  Teach manners as a way of loving neighbors not as pleasant social manipulation.  Dont pressure to get good grades. Whats important is to work diligently for God using abilities as stewards.  Its okay to praise children for doing whats right but dont reward for fulfilling normal responsibilities. Doing so encourages greedy selfinterest and obtaining rewards. They dont train children to behave when others arent watching.  Instead of telling child to share (behavior) help them understand and practice love for their neighbor (character).  Biblical incentives and rewards arent an end to themselves but outcomes of obedience to God.  Grounding isnt corrective its simply punitive.  Dont ask Why did you ...  because kids dont understand enough to answer. Instead ask What were you feeling ...  or What was the problem ...   When child becomes too focused on getting a new toy help them remember that toys bring only temporary joy.  Walk your child through  1. Nature of temptation  2. Possible responses to this temptation  3. Motives for those responses  4. The sinful response he chose  You stand above and beside your child. Above because God has called you to a role of discipline and correction. Beside because you too are a sinner.  Spanking   Verses supporting spanking Proverbs 23 1324 2215 291517 Heb 1211.   Spanking isnt optional God commands it.   Always spank in private to preserve childs dignity.   Tell child how many swats youll give to show that youre in control of yourself. Put child over your lap so spanking is in the context of your physical relationship.   After spanking child should be completely restored to you not mad.   After spanking pray with child.   For very young children spank only for defiance not for breaking house rules.   Its okay to use timeouts to supplement spanking but not to replace it.   If in public discipline in private. If child is very young you may overlook some things. Older children understand enough for later discipline to be effective.  Once or twice a year evaluate your children in three areas  1. Relationship to God  2. Relationship with self  3. Relationship with others  By appealing to childs conscience you avoid making a correction a contest between you and the child. The controversy is with God.  Teens   Instead of laying down the law with a teenager embrace accept and gently rebuke in love.   With teens dont waste your influence on things that dont matter such as dress and hairstyle.;Tedd Tripp

It contains both a biblical philosophy and its practical application. The main principle strike a balance between love and control. Dobson tells how to shape the childs will without breaking their spirit. He shows how to shape the will through strong leadership.  I didnt pick up as many techniques as Id hoped but the guidelines are good. Dobson seems to draw on a fairly small cherrypicked collection of studies for evidence. Many of the anecdotes dont add value.  I read this because we have a strongwilled 2yearold and Dobsons parenting books were recommended by Christian parents and a Christian doctor.  Shaping the will   Set rules and enforce them.   Deal with disobedience quickly and decisively.   Overlook childish irresponsibility but not willful defiance.   After punishment have a teachable moment and reassure of your love. Pray with child for forgiveness.   Let child know you love and care about them and they can come to you with concerns.  Young children   Anger and verbal outbursts are the most ineffective method they usually make things worse.   Warn kids a few minutes before play time ends.   Hold childs face look in eyes give direct command.   When child ignores your words squeeze nerve in shoulder muscles just enough to show youre serious.  Best parents excel at 3 functions  1. Theyre superb designers and organizers of their childrens environments.  2. They permit their children to interrupt them for brief 30second episodes during which personal consultation comfort information and enthusiasm are exchanged.  3. Theyre firm disciplinarians while simultaneously showing great affection for their children.  Discipline at different ages   1524 months Warn only once before punishing (slap on wrist or bottom). You can only do so much to improve toddler behavior. Some of it they must just outgrow.   23 years same as 1524 months with addition of timeout. timeout put in chair or bed and tell why. If they leave give small swat on legs or bottom with paddle or belt.   912 years Use physical punishment infrequently. Studies show its ineffective after age 10.  Spanking   Many studies of the effects of spanking dont separate out abuse and are skewed.   Studies dont show evidence that corporal punishment causes children to be aggressive.   Studies show spanking doesnt teach impulsive angry lashing out. Most parents spank purposely without anger.   To say that spanking teaches might makes right isnt fair parents routinely use power and restraint to control their children. When parents spank in love and for the childs benefit the child does not perceive it as bullying or demeaning.   Clinical field trials show spanking along with timeout and positive reinforcement is effective at decreasing noncompliant behavior.   Studies show spanking and child abuse are not strongly linked.   Use verbal correction timeout and logical consequences before resorting to spanking.   Start spanking at 15 to 18 months and use rarely after 6 years.   After 10 months a slap on the hand or wrist may be used after distraction and removal have failed.  Adolescence   By communicating kindness to your oppressed and harassed teenagers youll circumvent many of the disciplinary problems of adolescence.

Unfortunately the answers are very brief (half a page to 2 pages) and Sproul includes few verses making his answers sound like his informed opinions even though I know he has a biblical basis for his answers. He has deeper answers in his other publications and it would be nice if this book had referred the reader to those.  I dont agree with Sproul on everything but Ive learned a lot from him over the years and highly respect him as a theologian.  Below are my notes. Theyre taken from the book so they represent Sprouls views not necessarily mine.  Who Is Jesus  All these things in Matthew 24 Mark 13 and Luke 21 could refer to destruction of Jerusalem which happened in 1st century.  The Book of Books  Sproul looks to Augustine Aquinas Anselm Luther Calvin Edwards for biblical interpretation.  About the testaments Augustine said The Old is in the New revealed the New is in the Old concealed.  About 75 of NT is quotation from or allusion to OT.  The Way of Salvation  You dont get into heaven by your works but your reward in heaven will be according to those works.  I get into heaven by Jesus righteousness but my reward in heaven will be distributed according to my obedience.  Baptism isnt necessary for salvation see thief on cross.  The reprobate wont respond to Gods invitation because they dont want to. Its their very freedom thats keeping them away from Christ. They have the freedom to choose what they desire and they refuse Christ.  James 224 means that works justify a persons claim to faith before the eyes of man not that they add to the persons justification before God.  Sin and the Sinner  The NT says at least 25 times that well be rewarded in heaven according to our obedience or works. Jesus frequently said that on the last day well be judged for all our actions good and evil. The elect wont be punished for sin but it will lesson our reward.  Jesus statement to judge not refers to judgment as condemnation not judgment as discernment or evaluation. The Bible often tells us to judge between good and evil truth and lie.  The Growing Spiritual Life  Fasting is supported by OT and NT including Jesus. Protestants pushed aside because Catholics viewed it as meritorious. We should fast in ways that allow us to be good stewards of our bodies.  Heaven and Hell  We hope and have a certain level of confidence that God saves children of believers who die before they can believe. God made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants. David was confident hed see his child who died in heaven. Children are saved by grace not due to innocence.  Church Life  In 2 Tim 212 I think that what Paul is saying is that women can be involved in all kinds of functions of ministry in the church but that the role of juridical authority or of governing authority is not to be held by women. ... in certain denominations ordination means that a person has been given governing authority.  I am convinced that when Paul says the women are to cover their heads [in church] he is basing that action on how God created male and female. ... Im persuaded that the principle of covering the head is still in effect because it was built into creation.  God ordained the Sabbath at Creation so its still in effect. God says This is my Sabbath unto all generations (Exodus 3113). NT church worships on Lords Day (Sunday) (Heb 1025). It requires rest from unnecessary commerce and labor. Sproul holds Continental view seeing recreation as legitimate form of rest.  The heart of worship in the Bible is the proclamation of Gods Word. Yet in the OT worship involved all 5 senses. Modern worship should actively involve people too.  Sproul cant say for sure that pictures of Jesus violate 2nd Commandment but has a problem with them because they may give an inaccurate image.  Marriage and Family  OT implies that polygamy is wrong. Its contrary to Creation and was practiced by Cains ungodly descendants (including Lamech).  The Bible doesnt specifically address the issue of a mother working outside the home. The virtuous woman of Prov 31 is a mother who does business.  Divorce is only biblical for adultery (Matt 19) and willful and irreparable separation of unbelieving spouse (1 Cor 715).  1 Cor 715 means that innocent party is free to remarry. Sproul believes guilty party can remarry if they genuinely repent.  Career Issues  Theres nothing in Bible against Christians partnering with nonChristians in business. But Christians may experience friction with nonChristians due to different priorities.  Money Matters  OT doesnt speak of prosperity as a sin God frequently promises material well being to the obedient. Jesus spoke not against money but against prioritizing it above the Kingdom. God can bless with prosperity those seeking the Kingdom.  Tithing isnt explicitly repealed in NT so its still in effect. Since NT describes the new covenant as richer than the old a tenth is the bare minimum.  Biblical warnings against debt are wisdom sayings not absolute prohibitions.  The End Times  When Jesus said this generation will not pass until all these things be done (Matthew 2434) He was referring to destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.  Lifestyle Ethics  I would be very hesitant before imposing uniquely Christian principles upon nonChristians. Christians ought to protect 1st Amendment rights for ourselves and everyone else.  Turning the other cheek refers primarily to being insulted (backhanded slap to right cheek). Jesus meant we shouldnt be involved in bitter vindictiveness not that we need to be doormats or cant defend ourselves.  There may be occasions when its appropriate to lie to protect others. The Bible doesnt rebuke the Hebrew midwives Rahab or others who did so. Some say these people were blessed despite their lying not for it. Lying may be legitimate to prevent evil in cases of war murder and other criminal acts.  Christians and Government  The government doesnt need to enforce commandments given only to Christians (such as participation in Lords Supper). But the government should stand for what is right in those spheres of ethics that are right for all people.  Governments are to be ministers of God for sake of righteousness (Rom 13). Governments must uphold righteousness and justice. In OT Gods authority went beyond Israel to heathen rulers.  Puzzling Passages  God doesnt directly punish a person for someone elses sin but the consequences of sin can affect ones descendants (see 10 Commandments curse on Ham).;R.C. Sproul

Chapman says that people express love in five broad ways or love languages and he shows how to determine and speak your spouses love language. Chapman stresses the importance of communication and expectations in marriage. The book is mostly about love between spouses but theres a chapter near the end applying the lessons to parentchild relationships.  It sounds cheesy but the main concept is that each person has a love tank that must be filled for a person to feel loved. Your goal in marriage is to keep your spouses love tank full by speaking their love language. I liked Chapmans idea of a Love Tank Game in which spouses ask each other each evening after work On a scale of 0 to 10 how full is your love tank What can I do to fill it  My pastor recommended this book during premarital counseling. My wife had already read it and recommended it as well. Chapman is a Christian and he references the Bible throughout the book but the lessons apply to anyone regardless of religion.  The 5 Love Languages  Words of Affirmation praising  complimenting  Quality Time undivided attention  Receiving Gifts spontaneous gifts  Acts of Service chores and errands  Physical Touch hugging kissing sex  Clues to determine your love language  What you ask your spouse for  How you express love to your spouse  What you love or hate about your spouse  Take the quiz at httpwww.5lovelanguages.comassessm...  While reading the book I guessed that my primary love language is Words of Affirmation or Quality Time. According to the quiz my languages rank as Quality Time followed closely by Words of Affirmation then Acts of Service Physical Touch and Receiving Gifts. Im a minimalist so gifts arent very important to me. A good point for me to hear was that even if youre frugal and rarely buy yourself gifts youd do well to buy gifts for your spouse if gifts are her love language. Its not about you its about your spouse.  Additional notes  Request dont demand that your spouse perform acts of service.  Dont give advice unless youre asked for it just listen and sympathize.;Gary Chapman

Predestination and genuine choice taught in Eph 15 actions of Judas actions of Jesus actions of Jews who killed Jesus (Acts 223).  It is not as if God looked down on a neutral humanity deciding to make some believers and others reject him. Rather he looked upon a humanity already guilty in sin and unbelief. ...

Ziglar clearly experienced teaches through a multitude of examples. Its about inperson selling which is different from online in some ways. But the fundamentals of persuasion apply to any sales situation.  Ziglar is often more longwinded than necessary but its made more bearable by his humorous and lively writing style.  Ziglar explains that he wrote the book to help salespeople from all walks of life be more professional and successful.  Ziglar summarizes his approach early in the bookLearn as much as you can about your prospect and capitalize on that information. Learn how to use voice inflections which we will thoroughly cover throughout Secrets. Break the price into small segments. Optimistically sell and be hard of hearing. Ask questions to identify the problem and lead the prospect to the decision. Find out what he needs to solve his problem and show him how he can solve his problem with your product.  A main idea is that you must believe deeply that what you offer is in the best interests of the prospect. Then you can sincerely encourage them to buy for their benefit.  I read this because I handle sales for my web agency OptimWise. It was recommended by Seth Godin in All Marketers are Liars.  Below are my notes.  The Psychology of Closing  Dont argue since its difficult to antagonize and positively influence at the same time.  Be optimistic that your prospect can handle the purchase. Your expectancy influences the prospects decision.  You can sell more by asking than telling. Use the Socratic Method. Dont attempt to tell or sell since that leads the buyer to resist. By asking them questions they wont get unhappy with you because theyre giving the answers. The customer ends up persuading himself.  If your prospect wants to invest X dollars but his needs come to Xplus dollars then your real sale is the amount beyond what the prospect had already committed in his own mind.  Make it easy for them to buy. Break it down into small amounts so your prospects can afford it. Tell them if they think about the life of the product it only costs X per month day etc.  If a prospect asks for something specific and you cant provide it offer an alternative. Often theyll be open to one.  Use your imagination (get creative) to help the prospect get what they want.  In many cases the prospect says no because they dont know enough to say yes. Prospects who say no are actually asking for more info so they can feel secure that theyre making the right decision.  People buy when they want the item more than they want the money it costs.  When someone objects to your price say The price [pause] is too high That forces them to defend their statement instead of you justifying the price.  Handle objections by asking If there were a way I could show you that the price is fair and the product worth every penny would you take advantage of the offer today That helps determine if the objection is the price or something else. If they answer no ask Then there must be some other reason youre hesitating. Would you mind if I ask what that reason is  Say Price is a onetime thing cost is something youll be concerned about as long as you have a product. Some companies can beat us on price but we win on cost. Youre obviously costconscious so can you think of any reason you shouldnt immediately start enjoying the lowest cost  Say Cost can go on forever as long as you have the product. Wouldnt it be better to pay a fair price one time than to keep paying the little costs of a product thats not as good as what Im offering  Say We decided years ago that itd be easier to explain price one time than to apologize for poor quality or poor service forever [pause] and Ill bet youre glad we made that decision arent you  If you can make the prospect feel about your product the way you do theyll buy if they can come up with the money.  You must transfer the feeling of I believe in this product so strongly that I bought it myself.  If you dont honestly feel the prospect will lose out by not buying you wont be nearly as effective in sales.  Never confuse your situation with your prospects. Your wants needs desires tastes and capacity to pay have no bearing on the prospect.  The Heart of Your Sales Career  Point out the big picture cost. For example If you cant afford to repair your roof wont it be even more difficult to replace your furniture and repaint and still have to afford the new roof  Its highly likely that you can use the prospects reason for not buying as the reason they should buy. For example If youre serious when you say you cant afford this sales training course may I gently suggest that you need to take whatever steps are necessary to take it This course will help you sell more. How many extra sales would you need to make to get your investment back  You tell people from your head but you persuade and sell from the heart.  If you use all logic in a sales presentation the prospect will be educated and buy from someone else. If you use all emotion youll likely make the sale but the prospect will cancel the order. Use both logic and emotion to make a sale today and have a happy customer for the future.  Logic appeals to the eye emotion appears to the ear. Tell people what your product will do but also demonstrate it.  Words alone will often fail so he demonstrates to make the sale. A demonstration increases believability. If the buyer only hears something theyll forget if they only see it theyll remember it but if they hear see and do theyll understand and be more inclined to buy.  When youre talking to a prospect remember that in most cases theyre happy to give info if you just ask.  Dont put down the prospects previous purchase or previous salesperson or they may take it as an attack on their judgment. Say In retrospect most of us would make decisions differently. At that time you made this choice most people wouldve done the same thing you did so dont feel bad. The best way to get a prospect to make a favorable new decision is to make him happy with an old one.  Lack of trust is the major reason a prospect wont buy from you.  The Sales Professional  People often buy not because they understand the offer but because they feel you understand them.  Let the prospect use the product temporarily so they become attached to it.  You make the sale when the prospect understands that it will cost more to do nothing about the problem than to do something about it. Say If you buy the item the savings will pay for it. If you dont buy it your daily losses will soon be more than the cost. In other words you can get it and let it pay for itself or you can choose not to get it and still pay for it through losses. Since youve got to pay for it either way doesnt it make sense to get it  Dont just tell them  show the figures at the same time. Prospects make the decision to buy based on what they understand and believe.  Imagination and Word Pictures  Words that sell your prospects name understand proven health easy guarantee money safety save new love discovery right results truth comfort proud profit dessert happy trust value fun vital you security advantage positive benefits.  Words that unsell deal cost pay contract sign try worry loss lose hurt buy sell sold price decision hard difficult obligation liable liability fail failure.  Learn how to take the verbal paint brush and paint them (your prospects) right into the picture. You have got to put your prospect in the car and show him enjoying the luxury comfort or economy of driving your particular car. ... the picture must be in color and in the present tense. ... Word pictures should paint beauty luxury love satisfaction enjoyment success performance.  When the benefits are delayed for years it is important that an emotional picture of those delayed benefits be burned indelibly into that prospects mind. This greatly reduces the possibility of cancellation.  In most cases involving significant purchases if you do not encounter objections from the prospect ... you do not have a prospect. They wouldnt object if they werent interested.  When the prospect keeps objecting it could be that theyre not the decisionmaker. Ask If I can answer your question to your satisfaction that this is the right product at the right time and at the right price are you personally in a position to give me an order for the product today and would you be willing to do so  If prospect asks about price before youre ready say There are so many factors involved in price such as size model terms and deliver I hesitate to answer before we have narrowed down the choices I am about to offer you.  When prospect says they need to think about it say Sometimes when people say let me think about it what theyre really saying is they dont like the idea. Lets speak frankly for a moment. Please  dont just be polite. Is there something you feel uncomfortable about Something else you want to know  Offer the tangible as the reason for buying but emphasize the intangible as the excuse for buying. Example the reason for buying is a beautiful lake lot and the excuse for buying is relaxed living longer life etc.  The Nuts and Bolts of Selling  Ask Do you want this single unit or would you like three for a 15 discount In many cases you can sell a larger order by simply asking that.  If prospect asks Does it come in green ask Do you want it if it comes in green When he responds hes bought. Your tying him down with that.  Create a procon list in front of the customer. Put you like it as number one under pros. If youve done your job youll have far more pros than cons. Show the prospect the list and ask Which of these weigh heaviest This helps not only make the sale but keep the sale.  Ask Can you see how using this would increase your sales Are you interested in increasing your sales If you were ever going to start increasing your sales when do you think would be the best time to start  The Keys in Closing  Be an assistant buyer. Help the customer solve their problem by acquiring your products or services.  Listen with your eyes with CHEF  C chin or cheek. When prospect rubs or holds in hand its a satisfactiongratification sign. Nows the time to close.  H hands. If theyre gently massaging each other prospect is ready to buy.  E eyes. The wider the eyes the more hes listening and buying. If eyes are wide with crows feet and they begin to relax its time to close.  F friendly. When prospect smiles uses friendly phrases relaxes or becomes quiet and considering close the sale.  Listen for questions that show the prospect is ready to buy such as questions about model warranty payment etc.  Treat everyone as if he is a valuable customer. He is  or he could be if hes treated like one.;Zig Ziglar

This book doesnt contain as much action and the story wasnt as compelling but it does advance the story and fills in more blanks.  You can tell that Card is a political and military history buff and he spends too much time explaining the war between China India Thailand and other nations. At points this seems to distract from the characters stories.  In the first 2 books of this series Bean was a cold emotionless character. In this book Petra helps him find purpose in his life. Bean and Petra continue their efforts against Achilles and theyre again aided by Peter the Hegemon. Although Ender is barely mentioned in this book his parents John Paul and Theresa Wiggin play a large role alongside Peter. I liked the witty conversations between the parents and the way they interacted with their much younger but higher ranking son Peter.  Other familiar characters in this book include Anton Alai Graff and Suriyawong. Virlomi appears in a boring and unnecessary side story in which she starts a grassroots campaign against the Chinese occupants of Indian villages.

So I decided to give this a read. The writing quality was much higher than The Phantom Menace.  The main reason I read the novelizations is because they contain more detail and explanation than the movies. The movies focus on action and specialeffects and dont leave a lot of room to explore the characters motivations.  This book covered everything in the movie as far as I remember. It also contained a lot that wasnt in the movie   Shmi Skywalkers life with Cliegg Lars on Tatooine including Owen Lars and Beru Whitesun (later Luke Skywalkers Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru). The story of Shmis capture by Tusken Raiders and the attempt by Cliegg Owen and their neighbors to rescue her.   The Senate debating how to deal with the Confederation of Independent Systems.

SifoDyas told Kaminoans that Jedi had an aversion to leading droids and could only command an army of life forms. Thats why clones were chosen instead of droids.  After reading this a second time I grasp more of Palpatines master plan.  I was hoping the book would clear up the story of SifoDyas and the original order of the clones but it didnt. According to the Wookieepedia article on SifoDyas Ill have to read Star Wars Labyrinth of Evil for that.  I enjoyed this book although I wouldnt recommend it to nonStar Wars fans. And I still like the original trilogy (Episodes 46) much better than the prequel trilogy (Episodes 13).;R.A. Salvatore George Lucas Jonathan Hales

A friend who knows about my interest in backpacking gave me this book to borrow.  Id much rather learn about hiking and backpacking while actually on the trail so I cant say I especially enjoyed this book. But thats more a statement about booklearning versus handson learning than a reflection of the books quality. Its full of useful advice and makes a decent primer for the novice backpacker.  The book broadly covers many hiking and backpacking topics and is a livelier read than you might expect thanks to the authors humor and a decent number of illustrations and photos (some showcasing the clothing and grooming fashions of backwoods hikers).  The author provides tips for purchasing and using clothes packs cooking equipment tents and other gear. She suggests that you shop based on quality not price and keep in mind that although hiking gear may be expensive up front it allows you to take many inexpensive vacations.  Additional topics include comfortable walking habits packing and preparing food wilderness safety and survival finding (or avoiding) wildlife and navigation methods.;Karen Berger

Every day consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuffa lot of brown cows  but you can bet they wont forget a Purple Cow.

Youll stand out like a purple cow in a plain herd and people will notice and spread the word.  Godin a renowned marketing expert offers straightforward actionable advice and plenty of examples of entrepreneurs and companies both good and bad. I highly recommend it to marketers especially entrepreneurs and the selfemployed who market themselves.  Godins marketing plan Identify a specific problem in an underserved niche create a remarkable product (or service) that solves the problem and present it to passionate and influential early adopters or sneezers. These sneezers will naturally spread the word doing your advertising for you.  In his own words  Start with a problem that you can solve for your customer (who realizes he has a problem). Then once youve come up with a solution that is so remarkable that the early adopters among this population will gleefully respond youve got to promote it in a medium where those most likely to sneeze are actually paying attention.  Main ideas  Dont Be Boring Give people something worth talking about. Create remarkable products that the right people seek out.  Safe Is Risky Sticking to safe or proven products and services means theyre less likely to be noticed and purchased.  Design Rules Now Design products and services to market themselves.  Very Good Is Bad Very good is expected you must be extraordinary or remarkable to get attention.  Additional ideas  You must design a product that is remarkable enough to attract the early adopters  but is flexible enough and attractive enough that those adopters will have an easy time spreading the idea to the rest of the curve.  Be controversial youll earn both criticism and praise which are better than lukewarm apathy. Be spoofworthy stand out so much that you invite parody.  Its not about being weird. Its about being irresistible to a tiny group of easily reached sneezers with otaku. Irresistable isnt the same as ridiculous. Irresistible (for the right niche) is just remarkable. Otaku is a nearobsession about your type of product or service.  Offer the most the product or service thats the cheapest fastest slowest easiest hardest etc.;Seth Godin

Surely our profession Mr. Mac would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results.

Here are my notes mostly quoted straight from the book  Manager Types  Autocratic   Tough   Interested in results   Profitminded   Organization wins while people lose  Democratic   Nice   Interested in people   People win while organization loses  People who feel good about themselves produce good results.  One minute goal setting  1. Agree on your goals.  2. See what good behavior looks like.  3. Write out each of your goals on a single sheet of paper using less than 250 words.  4. Read and reread each goal which requires only a minute or so each time you do it.  5. Take a minute every once in a while out of your day to look at your performance and  6. See whether or not your behavior matches your goals.  Help people reach their full potential. Catch them doing something right.  One minute praising  1. Tell people up front that you are going to let them know how they are doing.  2. Praise people immediately.  3. Tell people what they did right  be specific.  4. Tell people how good you feel about what they did right and how it helps the organization and the other people who work there.  5. Stop for a moment of silence to let them feel how good you feel.  6. Encourage them to do more of the same.  7. Shake hands or touch people in a way that makes it clear that you support their success in the organization.  One minute reprimand  1. Tell people beforehand that you are going to let them know how they are doing and in no uncertain terms.  the first half of the reprimand  2. Reprimand people immediately.  3. Tell people what they did wrong  be specific.  4. Tell people how you feel about what they did wrong  and in no uncertain terms.  5. Stop for a few seconds of uncomfortable silence to let them feel how you feel.  the second half of the reprimand  6. Shake hands or touch them in a way that lets them know you are honestly on their side.  7. Remind them how much you value them.  8. Reaffirm that you think well of them but not of their performance in this situation.  9. Realize that when the reprimand is over its over.  The best minute I spend is the one I invest in people.  Everyone is a potential winner. Some people are disguised as losers dont let their appearances fool you.  Hiring choices  1. Hire a winner theyre hard to find and expensive.  2. Hire someone with potential to be a winner train them to be a winner.  3. Hire someone whos not a winner and doesnt have potential to be a winner pray that the person works out.  Take a minute  Look at your goals  Look at your performance  See if your behavior matches your goals.  Gunnysack discipliners store up observations of poor behavior then dump them on the person all at once. Instead remember that performance review is an ongoing process not just an annual event.  With the leave alonezap style you leave a person alone expecting good performance from them and when you dont get it you zap them. Instead tell people what you expect then give them plenty of feedback.  We are not just our behavior we are the people managing our behavior.  Manipulation is getting people to do something theyre not aware of or dont agree to. To avoid it always let a person know up front what you are doing and why.  Goals begin behaviors consequences maintain behaviors.;Kenneth H. Blanchard Spencer Johnson
1067;819058;2;50548;0345427653;When casting about for an author to novelize the script for The Phantom Menacethe first in a series of three prequels to the eternally popular Star Warssagaits no surprise that creator George Lucas called on Terry Brooks to novelize the biggest science fiction movie of all time. After all Brooks is a perennially bestselling epic fantasy author whose Sword of Shannarais a classic adventure story not far removed from the swashbuckling exploits of our favorite Star Warsheroes. Brooks handles the job of modern mythmaker well. He deftly juggles a hodgepodge of characters a young stately queen (Amidala) and her handmaidens a pair of Jedi knights (ObiWan Kenobi and QuiGon Jinn) a bumbling amphibious sidekick (Jar Jar Binks) two Sith Lords (Darths Maul and Sidious) who add more than enough menace to the mix a couple of familiar robots (C3P0 and R2D2) a teeming host of Senators Chancellors diplomats warrior droids and spies and one young slave boy who aspires to be a Jedi knight (Anakin Skywalker). With cinematic prose Brooks brings to life a number of epic battles skirmishes and dogfights in spaceall the elements that weve come to expect from a rousing Star Warsinstallment. The Phantom Menacedoesnt stray far from those expectations there is a clear division between the good guys and the bad good things come in small (and surprising) packages and heroes lose battles only to emerge victorious on another day. But Phantomdoes illuminate in ways the other installments didnt. For the first time we get a glimpse at the whys and wherefores behind the curtain at times the book reads almost like a sociopolitical thriller as the emerging Federation shuffles for power with the waning democracy of the Republic. The Force is also further illuminated. Turns out it has something to do with midichloriansmicroscopic life forms that live in the cells of all creatures.The Phantom Menaceis a fun read sure to satisfy Star Warsjunkies young and old. And dont forget turn your light saber off beforeyou enter the swamp or youll fry your energy pack.

I love the original Star Wars trilogy (Episodes 4  6) so I remember how disappointed I was when Episode 1 came out. The acting was terrible I hated Jar Jar Binks and the podrace takes up way too much time. Still the story does cover important details of the Star Wars saga so I decided to try the novelization to see if it was any better.  Compared to the writing quality of The Star Wars Trilogy I found the quality of this book lower. Maybe it was aimed at a younger audience but the vocabulary was significantly simpler.  The book contains a few scenes that arent in the movie. A few events take place before the point where the movie begins including Anakin podracing and going into town with his friends. Anakin also visits Mos Espa to buy parts for Watto and saves an injured Tusken Raider he encounters in the desert. The book contains more information about the history of the Sith and Jedi than the movie explained including the story of Darth Bane. The book has more about Anakins thoughts including his budding infatuation with Padme.  If youre a Star Wars fan its worth a read. Otherwise its a total waste.  Notes  Jedi started as theological and philosophical study group. Only gradually became aware of presence of the force. Slowly evolved from isolated meditation to outward social responsibility. Mastery of the force required service to greater community and implementation of just laws.  Anakin built C3PO to help him trade with Jawas. He chose 3 because C3PO was 3rd member of his family. Anakin later tells Padme that hes building C3PO to help his mom.  Anakin tells Padme that he will marry her when he first meets her.  Sith began 2000 years before Episode 1 by rogue Jedi knight who sought to use Force for power. Sith grew until they went to war with Jedi. Sith destroyed own founder then each other. Jedi destroyed survivors except one who went into hiding. Darth Bane reinvented the Sith and trained an apprentice who would do the same. There would only ever be 2 at a time to prevent infighting. This was 1000 years before Episode 1.  After winning the podrace Anakin fights a Rodian. Hes driven by anger at feeling that he lost Padme.  Yoda disagreed with Jedi Council about their decision to train Anakin.;Terry Brooks

But technical mastery of ones discipline is not enough assert worldrenowned professional advisors David H. Maister Charles H. Green and Robert M. Galford. The key to professional success they argue is the ability to earn the trust and confidence of clients. To demonstrate the paramount importance of trust the authors use anecdotes experiences and examples  successes and mistakes their own and others  to great effect. The result is an immensely readable book that will be welcomed by the inexperienced advisor and the most seasoned expert alike.;256;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Trusted Advisor;nonfiction;This should be required reading for consultants and advisors. It explains that getting hired and rehired is about earning trust and walks through many ways to build trust. There are plenty of realworld examples from the authors three experienced consultants.  Its logically organized and I like how often lists are used.  I read this because I spend a lot of time interacting with clients in running my web design agency OptimWise.  My favorite points   Act as if youre advising your parents not your children.   Manipulate the clients emotions without being manipulative.   Socializing isnt necessary but being sociable is.   Be the first one to take a personal risk (let your guard down). Dont wait for the client.   Ask how do you feel about that   Dont jump into solving the problem. Spend more time defining it and talking about the end state with the client.   Respect the clients deadline even if its artificial or arbitrary.   Dont blame anybody for anything anytime.  Below are my notes.  Perspectives on Trust  Traits of trusted advisors   Help client think things through (its clients decision)   Dont substitute their judgment for clients   Give client reasoning (to help them think) not just their conclusions   Give client options increase their understanding of those options give them the recommendation and let them choose  Success in client relationships is tied to the accumulation of quality experiences. Seek out (rather than avoid) clientcontact experiences and take personal risks with clients.  Clients want advisors who   Understand their interests and will put the clients interests first   Can be trusted to do the right thing   Will care  How to give advice   Act as if youre advising your parents not your children. Youre more likely to find the right words to convey your point with respect and to soften any critique.   A primary task is to defuse defensiveness. Prove youre trying to help not criticize.   Focus less on the adviceconclusion and more on creating a conversation to help them see that issue from a new perspective.   Clients dont always want advice they often just want a sympathetic ear.  Youre more likely to be trusted if you say Im not completely sure how to deal with this can I talk it over with you Then if you say leave it to me Ill solve everything  The client is primarily interested in having the problem understood in all its emotional and political complexity as a precondition to having the problem diagnosed and solved.  Manipulate the clients emotions without being manipulative. Use trustbuilding techniques.  Stop serving clients who can see that youre not fully engaged. The damage to your reputation will outlast any income penalty. Reputation before revenue  Occasional socializing can be enjoyable but earning trust is not about sporting events and dinners. Socializing isnt necessary but being sociable is. Its the window into the clients needs hopes fears.  The Structure of Trust Building  Trust Equation T  (C  R  I)S where T  trustworthiness C  credibility R  reliability I  intimacy S  selforientation  Be expert at a variety of small touches that build familiarity. For example stay current on client events and names. The more you can understand and relate to the unconscious norms of the client the more reliable theyll feel you are.  You can have a close relationship with the client without having anything to do with their life outside of work. Its about emotional closeness concerning the issues at hand.  Be the first one to take a personal risk (let your guard down) to share something of what you see feel or think. Dont wait for the client.  Take most of the responsibility for failed communications.  Talk to your client as if he is a friend. Were concerned about our friends and their wellbeing and it shows in our conversational style.  Five stages of building trust  1. Engage use language of interest and concern. Ive been thinking about your competitors and ... Your people have been telling me about ...  2. Listen use language of understanding and empathy. Tell me more about ... Whats behind that That must feel ...  3. Frame use language of perspective and candor. I see three key themes emerging here ... You know whats tough to do here is ...  4. Vision use language of possibility. Wouldnt it be great if ...  5. Commit use language of joint exploration. What would it take for each of us to ...  Talk about competitive career and personal issues. These conversations contrast with more content or expertiserelated conversations.  Dont make early interactions purely transactional. If you focus strictly on the content youll be paid more as a technician in as an advisor. Talk to them as if they are a new friend not an old friend.  What good listeners do   Ask how do you feel about that   Ask how they think you might be of help   Ask what theyve thought of before telling them what youve thought of  After stating enough responsibilitytaking caveats say the thing that must be said even if it seems risky.  Instead of asking why dont we ... ask how would things be if ... Focus on descriptive sentences. Ask questions about things like benefits end states outcomes.  After the problem is defined the client will ask what can we do about this Say hold on well get there but lets talk about where we want to go and what were trying to achieve.  Effective counseling (reimbursed or not) can be the most effective means of generating future revenues. Would you rather be someones counselor or write proposals  Putting Trust to Work  Instead of pitching get to work immediately. Act as if the project has already started. Show the prospect what it feels like to be in a relationship. The best selling technique is to not sell but to commence the service process. Clients dont want to buy air unless they can breathe it first. They prefer to buy based on a sample.  Professionals sell confidence security and ease.  Factors that increase clients perceived value of service   Understanding   Sense of control   Sense of progress   Access and availability   Responsiveness   Reliability   Appreciation   Sense of importance   Respect  Clients often forget the promises we keep but remember the promises we didnt fulfill.  Respect the clients deadline even if its artificial or arbitrary. If its unreasonable its better to ask for an extension or even argue about it then miss it.  Dont blame anybody for anything anytime.;David H. Maister Charles H. Green Robert M. Galford

I had too many unanswered questions about Paks capture by the Iynisin I wanted more background info about the Iynisin the elves and their cultures.

It definitely was Kiyosaki admits that hes not the best writer and I agree but he has a compelling way of teaching important business and financial lessons through stories about his past.  He shamelessly plugs his books board games and website but it works he sells tons of them and I put several more of his books on my toread list.  The books main point is that you cant get ahead by simply working harder or working more hours. You need to use various forms of leverage. As Kiyosaki puts it Leverage is the ability to do more and more with less and less. Keep adding leverage he promises and youll earn more and more by doing less and less work.  I really liked Kiyosakis explanation of income as earned portfolio or passive income and how to use portfolio and passive income to minimize taxes and maximize what you keep.  Although Kiyosaki made his wealth mostly in real estate his lessons apply to any area of business.  Notes  Money doesnt make you happy but it buys you the time to do what you love and pay others do do what you hate.  Use debt (other peoples money) not equity (your own money).  Invest for cash flow not capital appreciation. Cash flow gives you money now but capital appreciation may never occur.  The most important word in money is cash flow. The second most important is leverage.  Good debt puts money in your pocket every month. Bad debt takes money out of your pocket every month.  Buy assets not liabilities.  Supplement old financial tools like mutual funds with faster safer more informationrich tools.  The rich use financial leverage while the poor use physical leverage (hard work).  Forms of leverage   debt   other peoples money   other peoples time   health   time  to find opportunities   education   relationships  business and personal. Its who you know not what you know.   tools   spare time  do something worthwhile instead of meaningless leisure  3 kinds of education  1. academic  2. professional  3. financial  The poor stop at academic or professional. The rich move up to financial.  A winning strategy must include losing. If you expect to win 100 of the time youll never take the chances you need to succeed.  Think in terms of risk and reward not right or wrong risky or safe.  Instead of asking for more money for doing less work do more for more people.  3 types of income  Earned (50 money)   paycheck from job   government takes 50   401(k) fits here because withdrawals are taxed  Portfolio (20 money)   paper assets (stocks bonds mutual funds)   government takes 1520 of capital gains  Passive (0 money)   real estate royalties intellectual property   taxdeferred   government takes as little as 0 for taxfree munis depreciation from property improvements and deferred capital gains on real estate that are rolled into charitable remainder trusts  Business owners can buy many things with pretax dollars but employees use aftertax dollars.

Have a reality that can change expand and grow quickly.  Expand your contextrealitymind rather than increasing your contentinformation.  Your future is determined by what you do today not tomorrow regardless of your dreams.  Stop doing today what you dont want to do in the future. Do today what you want for your tomorrows.  Use faster words   cash flow from assets instead of a highpaying job   make money instead of save money   depreciation (asset gives immediate cash flow even though it may lose its value over time) instead of appreciation (waiting for asset to increase in value before you profit) (make profit when you buy not sell)   invest in private companies instead of public companies   go to seminars instead of school  The value of your labor increases incrementally.

Leverage generosity  The Law of Reciprocity give and you shall receive  serve more and more people  be generous with your money give to charities  Everyone has financial problems whether rich or poor.

Later accused of murder and denounced for philandering everywhere he goes Smith prompts his newfound acquaintances to recognize an important idea in most unexpected ways.;160;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1328866065m899146.jpg;Manalive;fiction;This is a story about being alive and appreciating life. It presents an optimistic view of excitement levity property home and marriage. Its the story of Smith a man who refuses to die while he is still alive. He seeks to remind himself by every electric shock to the intellect that he is still a man alive.  As Smith says the world when all is said and done is a wonderful and beautiful place ...  I liked the thoughtprovoking moral but didnt get really much out of the story. I didnt like the style (especially Part 2 the trial) and felt it couldve been much more concise.  I read the free ebook from Project Gutenberg.  Below are several quotes.  Quotes  Imprudent marriages roared Michael. And pray where in earth or heaven are there any prudent marriages Might as well talk about prudent suicides. You and I have dawdled round each other long enough and are we any safer than Smith and Mary Gray who met last night You never know a husband till you marry him. Unhappy of course youll be unhappy. ... Disappointed of course well be disappointed. I for one dont expect till I die to be so good a man as I am at this minute a tower with all the trumpets shouting.  [D]ont tell me I confuse enjoyment of existence with the Will to Live  [H]e was only our own youth returned.  I mean to keep those bullets for pessimistspills for pale people.  I am going to hold a pistol to the head of the Modern Man. But I shall not use it to kill himonly to bring him to life.  In each case the scare was so wholesome that the victim himself has dated from it as from a new birth. Smith so far from being a madman is rather a mad doctor he walks the world curing frenzies and not distributing them.  Though not an optimist in the absurd sense of maintaining that life is all beer and skittles he did really seem to maintain that beer and skittles are the most serious part of it.  [D]eath was their only chance of learning to live.  He lashed his soul with laughter to prevent it falling asleep.  I think God has given us the love of special places of a hearth and of a native land for a good reason. ... Because otherwise he said pointing his pole out at the sky and the abyss we might worship that. ... Eternity ... the largest of the idols the mightiest of the rivals of God. You mean pantheism and infinity and all that.  Yes Innocent Smith has behaved ... upon a plain and perfectly blameless principle. It is odd and extravagant in the modern world ... His principle can be quite simply stated he refuses to die while he is still alive. He seeks to remind himself by every electric shock to the intellect that he is still a man alive walking on two legs about the world. For this reason he fires bullets at his best friends for this reason he arranges ladders and collapsible chimneys to steal his own property for this reason he goes plodding around a whole planet to get back to his own home and for this reason he has been in the habit of taking the woman whom he loved with a permanent loyalty and leaving her about ... so that he might recover her again and again with a raid and a romantic elopement. He seriously sought by a perpetual recapture of his bride to keep alive the sense of her perpetual value and the perils that should be run for her sake.  He has broken the conventions but he has kept the commandments.  It is just because he does not want to kill but to excite to life that a pistol is still as exciting to him as it is to a schoolboy. It is just because he does not want to steal because he does not covet his neighbours goods that he has captured the trick ... of coveting his own goods. It is just because he does not want to commit adultery that he achieves the romance of sex it is just because he loves one wife that he has a hundred honeymoons.;G.K. Chesterton

In this book he explains that the market is highly efficient and no one can accurately predict its ups and downs its a random walk. So the best approach is passive buy and hold investing using diversified index funds held long term. I recommend this book to investors of any level especially those attracted to active speculative investing.  The book begins with a fairly boring recount of several financial bubbles throughout history to prove the irrational exuberance of investors. Malkiel shows that despite shortterm trends the market always corrects itself value will out as he puts it. Crazed investors rush into revolutionary new companies and technologies but the key to investing is not how much an industry will affect society or how fast it will grow but its ability to sustain profits. In truth most IPOs underperform.  Several investing techniques and theories are evaluated including technical analysis fundamental analysis firm foundation theory the castle in the air theory efficient market theory and modern portfolio theory. Malkiel uses the efficient market theory to explain the markets efficiencies and modern portfolio theory in advising how to construct a diversified portfolio.  Malkiel makes a compelling case that active investing is a losing game. Active investors generally underperform passive investors because they fail to time their purchases and sales correctly and they incur transaction fees and taxes on their short term gains. Only 13 of active investors (individual traders and fund managers) beat the SP 500 in the short term and almost none beat it over the long term. In this section and throughout the book Malkiel often refers to John Bogle champion of indexing and founder of the Vanguard Group. Im something of a Bogle disciple and highly recommend his book The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.  After providing a lot of background information Malkiel finally gets to the part I was looking for specific financial advice. He explains asset allocation and diversification and how to build a portfolio based on your age and risk tolerance. I was hoping for example portfolios showing asset allocations for various age ranges but Malkiel shies away from such detailed recommendations. For people in their 20s like me he suggests investing aggressively in stocks including international and emerging markets. See my notes below for more of his advice.  One of the main themes is the relationship between risk and reward. Malkiel puts it this way you must decide whether youd rather eat well or sleep well. Higher risk is more likely to yield higher returns allowing you to eat well but the stress may cost you your sleep. Only you know the risk youre willing to take for the potential reward.  The book ends with an explanation of hedging with derivatives such as futures put options and call options. I didnt pay much attention and plan to stick with his simpler advice on diversified indexing.  Notes  Ignore short term volatility buy and hold for the long term.  Its financially wise to own your home. Its an inflation hedge provides tax breaks and forces saving.  The market trends upward so its better to invest a lump sum today than to dollar cost average. For investors without lump sums however dollar cost averaging is the most common and reasonable approach.  Save for financial goals using vehicles that mature at the goal date (CDs treasuries bonds etc.).  Portfolio construction  Diversify to reduce risk. Choose assets with low or no correlation. Include US stocks international stocks emerging market stocks REITs bonds TIPs and cash.  Hold bonds and bond funds in tax sheltered accounts.  Small cap stocks tend to outperform large cap. This may be due to higher risk or survivorship bias.  Value stocks tend to outperform growth because investors tend to overpay for growth.  REITs add diversity and have returns similar to stocks. They also provide an inflation hedge.  Selecting funds  Choose no load total stock market index funds.  If you buy active funds choose no load low turnover low expense funds with little unrealized appreciation.  Look for expense ratios less than 0.5 and turnover less than 50.;Burton G. Malkiel

Tolkiens threevolume epic is set in the imaginary world of Middleearth  home to many strange beings and most notably hobbits a peaceloving little people cheerful and shy. Since its original British publication in 195455 the saga has entranced readers of all ages. It is at once a classic myth and a modern fairy tale. Critic Michael Straight has hailed it as one of the very few works of genius in recent literature. Middleearth is a world receptive to poets scholars children and all other people of good will. Donald Barr has described it as a scrubbed morning world and a ringing nightmare world...especially sunlit and shadowed by perils very fundamental of a peculiarly uncompounded darkness. The story of ths world is one of high and heroic adventure. Barr compared it to Beowulf C.S. Lewis to Orlando Furioso W.H. Auden to The Thirtynine Steps. In fact the saga is sui generis  a triumph of imagination which springs to life within its own framework and on its own terms.;423;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings 1);fantasy paranormal;I love this first part of my favorite fantasy tale The Lord of the Rings.

The chapter for each topic has a brief commentary then quotes the relevant verses (from the NASB) with the applicable parts of the verses bolded. A few verses struck me as irrelevant but the vast majority are on point. This book helped me think though the Bibles teachings on financial principles.  The author says there are over 1000 references to money in the Bible second only to the subject of love.  Notes  Right Attitudes  Contentment doesnt mean complacency. We change the things we can and accept and are content with things we cant. Luke 314 Acts 203335 Phil 41114.  Trust God to provide what you need. Matt 62534 7911 Luke 122934 Phil 46.  Wrong Attitudes  Dont be proud about or trust in wealth. Job 312425 3619 1 Tim 617.  Bible says we shouldnt sue believers but just because it doesnt say we shouldnt sue a nonChristian doesnt make it right. Isa 594 Matt 540 Luke 62931 1 Cor 61 7.  Credit  God doesnt prohibit using credit He simply gives 3 guidelines  1. Credit shouldnt be normal.  2. Credit shouldnt be longterm.  3. Dont sign surety (take on an obligation to pay) without an absolutely certain way to pay.  There are few verses about paying interest but many telling us not to charge interest. Ex 2225 Deut 231920 Ps 155 Prov 288 Ezek 1879 1213 1618 221213.  Dont sign surety (deposit a pledge for future payment) without a sure and certain way to pay in full. Otherwise you presume upon the future and Gods will. Instead collateralize debts. Prov 615 1115 1718 222627.  Dont charge usury (exorbitant or abusive interest). [Author defines this as more than 1 per month but doesnt give Bible reference for this.] Lev 253537 Neh 5710 Prov 288.  Giving and Providing  To give first fruits means to tithe on gross (pretax) income. Tithe profit from sale of home inheritance insurance income dividends interest. Ex 3426 Num 181213 Deut 184 Neh 103739 Prov 3910 Ezek 4430.  3 levels of giving in OT  1. Tithe (minimum 110)  2. Offering (giving above tithe to meet specific needs)  3. Sacrificial giving (giving up what we want)  We should have short term plans (budget) and long term plans. Gen 413436 4724 1 Chron 225 14 Prov 215 272324 3025 Luke 142830.  Jews gave 3 tithes totaling an average 23.5  1. Annual to storehouse  2. For Jewish widows and orphans  3. For Gentile widows and orphans (every 3rd year)  Gods Blessings and Curses  Material blessings Gen 1514 243536 263 1214 3926 Deut 288 11 30811 Josh 18.  God sometimes disciplines His people by withholding or removing material things.

Bible says wealth includes salvation peace creative abilities health.  Investing  Bible says a lot about investing but its always to satisfy future needs for self family body of Christ.  We must buy what we need rather than what we want. That doesnt mean God wont allow us to have material things beyond basic necessities just that we must be good stewards.  Theres nothing wrong with multiplying assets so long as its done to benefit the kingdom. Matt 251430.  We may save but not hoard. Prov 668 2120 Ecc 112.  Work and Wages  We may enjoy our earnings.

Summary  1. Covenant of faith made with Abraham was also to his children. This covenant applies to all believers today.  2. In covenant parent has headship and represents children.  3. A covenant sign (circumcision baptism) is a seal (a visible pledge that covenant promises will apply when conditions of faith are met) so the sign doesnt have to be tied to the moment of conversion).  4. Children would have been included as members of households that were baptized.  5. Immersion isnt only acceptable mode of baptism.  Notes  Sign of covenant (circumcision) was given after covenant was made. It was neither precondition of covenant nor means of manufacturing it.  Abraham as head of household was to devote all members of his household to God and show it by circumcision even though all members hadnt expressed faith.  Principal of child being covenantally represented by parents faith shown by 1 Cor 714 (children of believers  holy).  Faith wasnt prerequisite for circumcision in OT because it was sign and seal (Romans 411).  In NT God continues to relate to his people as individuals and as families (Acts 23839 Gal 37 17 29).  Covenant continues from OT to NT but sign changed to reflect Gods work in maintaining his promises (Christs death). In OT circumcision signified removal of sin (Heb 1010 1 Pet 118). In NT baptism signifies same (Acts 2216 1 Cor 611 Heb 914).  Col 21112 shows baptism replaces circumcision.  Rescinding of covenant sign from children of believers would have been a major change and we would expect Scripture to record it.  Every person identified as having a household present at his or her conversion also had their household baptized. No evidence that children were excluded. Acts 104748 1615 188 1 Cor 114 16.  Bible doesnt mean immersion every time it speaks of baptism. Mark 724 Heb 91022 Luke 1138 Ex 2468 Luke 613 Acts 15 21718 Titus 356.;Bryan Chapell

Like the first book I thought Kvothe was too cocky and I quickly tired of his incessant habit of getting into and out of trouble. Overall my thoughts can be summarized by a quote from Kvothe himself when he says of his story its not a rousing epic meant to stir the blood.  The chapters with Felurian are long drawn out and boring. My favorite parts were the unraveling of the conspiracy against Maer Alveron and Tempis explanation of how the Adem show emotion through hand gestures rather than facial expression.  The voice talent in the Brilliance Audio audiobook is amazing.  Quotes  Clothes do not make the man but you need the proper costume if you want to play the part.  ...nothing in the world is harder than convincing someone of an unfamiliar truth.

The departure of the bearers of the three rings of the elves (Gandalf Galadriel and Elrond) in The Grey Havens.  Appendices  The appendices are required reading for Tolkien fans. One of my favorite parts is Appendix A Part III Durins Folk. It reveals some of the backstory of The Hobbit. Gandalf explains that Sauron intended to attack Rivendell and only the dwarves of the Iron Hills stood in his way. Also Gandalf feared that Sauron might use Smaug with terrible effect. So when he met Thorin by chance in Bree he encouraged him in his quest to reclaim Erebor in hopes of bringing about Smaugs death. Gandalf says Think of what might have been. Dragonfire and savage swords in Eriador night in Rivendell ... But that has been averted  because I met Thorin Oakenshield one evening on the edge of spring in Bree.

Ive been a SpiderMan fan since growing up on the 1990s TV show so I figured I couldnt go wrong with a book entitled Best of SpiderMan. I was wrong. I liked the first story Transformations Literal  Otherwise which first appeared as the comics Amazing SpiderMan 3035 and took up about half of the book. I also liked Amazing SpiderMan 36 a special 911 tribute. I skimmed through the rest of the comics but couldnt find anything that grabbed my attention. These were mostly focused on the Kingpin Rhino Punisher and Daredevil and SpiderMan seemed to only make small cameos.

It covers many topics of interest to Christian business owners including keeping vows hiring borrowing pricing lawsuits and tithing. It advocates a different approach to running a business one more concerned with eternity than profits. Im not sure I agree with Burkett 100 on all points but even so his book is a worthwhile guide to what the Bible says on these topics.  Burkett seems to cherrypick verses a bit I wish he referenced more verses when possible to give a fuller biblical perspective. The anecdotes are more numerous and longer than necessary to make the point.  Burkett seems to hold a double standard in that he says your counselors should be Christian so they share your Christian worldview but that you should not consider religion when hiring (so that you can evangelize unbelieving employees). Perhaps the standards are different because counselors can change the course of your business but employees generally cant.  Personal Lifestyle Goals  Luke 1222 is not an invitation to ignore the future but rather to avoid being consumed by fear of the future. Luke 1428 uses preconstruction planning as an example of proper planning. Prov 669 uses the ant as a model of saving for the future. Ants dont hoard they store only what they need. Luke 223536 seems to indicate that the problem is not so much with retaining resources as with depending on them more than on God. Scripture recommends retaining only modest surpluses to avoid dangers of materialism.  Jesus didnt teach believers to sell everything and be paupers but He did warn against dangers of wealth (Lk 1824). The proper desire is between poverty and riches (Prov 3079).  Biblical Business Goals  Just as a thermometer doesnt make a room hot or cold but measures the temperature so money doesnt make us spiritual or carnal it reflects who we are.  The Benefits of Counsel  Dont use unbelievers as your primary counselors (those who advise you day by day) (Ps 113). The difficulty isnt in the advice they give its the advice they dont give specifically the lack of spiritual insight.  Hiring Decisions  Hiring only Christians stifles one of the greatest ministries available to Christian employers evangelization of employees. 2 Cor 614 (dont be unequally yoked) doesnt apply to employeremployee relationship which is unequal. In 1 Cor 5910 Paul tells the church they dont need to separate from all unbelievers.  Firing Decisions  Before considering firing someone communicate expectations clearly communicate dissatisfactions clearly and quickly in writing and have a trial correction period. Never let sun go down on a problem without making a promise to handle it.  Borrowing Decisions  Borrowing was allowed in OT thats why year of remission and year of Jubilee were necessary. Rom 138 doesnt forbid borrowing if it did Paul wouldve been clear that he was changing OT doctrine. Rom 138 is in context of paying taxes and tells Christians to not be left owing anything even Roman taxes.  Principles (not commandments) of borrowing Dont borrow needlessly. Dont sign surety. Dont take on longterm debt. Prov 227 613 2016 Deut 151  We are commanded to repay what we owe (Ps 3721 Matt 52526).  Debt is not a problem it is a symptom. The problem is the consistent and systematic disregard for biblical principles. Debt is the result.  Lending Decisions  It isnt the use of credit that is unscriptural its the misuse.  Dont sue Christians (1 Cor 67).  Bible doesnt directly teach that you cant sue nonChristians but dont sue out of anger revenge greed. Consider Lk 630.  Its not unscriptural to sue a corporation even one owned by a Christian because its a legal entity that has chosen to abide by the laws of corporations. Paul appealed to Roman law (Acts 16 25) and we can appeal to laws of our lands. For same reason its not wrong to defend yourself or your business in court.  Corporations and Partnerships  Stock ownership isnt a yoke relationship.  Business Tithing  Tithing was never a commandment because no punishment was prescribed for failing to tithe. Tithing was voluntary (2 Cor 97) though there was a consequence for not tithing (Mal 39).  NT didnt change principle of tithing.  Business owners should tithe from gross not net. OT farmers tithed on harvest which was before expenses associated with harvest (Prov 39).  Retirement Decisions  Only 1 verse refers to retirement Num 825 which refers to priests retiring from service to perform other duties (not to be idle).  Its biblical to slow down with age but not stop (Prov 668). Its prudent to plan but not to hoard (Lk 121621).;Larry Burkett

Through a powerful and engaging narrative we confront many of the typical problems all entrepreneurs face in starting up their business from finding new sources of revenue to securing the commitment of their people and the loyalty of their customers. More important we learn the secrets to becoming a successful entrepreneur including how to build a firm foundation how to ensure a steady cash flow and how to create legendary service. In addition the book offers invaluable advice delivered through One Minute Insights from such entrepreneurs and thinkers as Sheldon Bowles Peter Drucker Michael Gerber and Charlie Tremendous Jones.Today in the midst of the largest entrepreneurial surge in U.S. history four out of five small businesses continue to fail. THE ONE MINUTE ENTREPRENEUR offers businesspeople and wouldbe entrepreneurs a treasure trove of wisdom on how to think act and succeed in creating and sustaining a business no matter what their industry.;160;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1320409335m2175786.jpg;The One Minute Entrepreneur The Secret to Creating and Sustaining a Successful Business;nonfiction;A simple fictional story that teaches many valuable lessons about life as an entrepreneur. The style is very similar to The One Minute Manager except that this story seems more realistic because of the character development and reallife people who appear in it. Were introduced to the main character in his high school years and follow him as he starts a business. As he deals with the victories and defeats of running his business he learns many important concepts of personal and professional growth.  Many famous people are quoted or make cameo appearances including Peter Drucker Michael Gerber Zig Ziglar Stephen Covey and Jim Collins. At the end of each chapter are One Minute Insights short memorable bullet points of the chapters takeaways.  This book is definitely not a handbook for starting or running a business and it doesnt claim to be. Its more an introduction to what to expect as a smallbusiness owner and a series of lessons on how to succeed. I read it because Im contemplating starting my own business and this was a good foretaste for the various milestones and challenges I may face. The book is optimistic overall but doesnt paint an unrealistically rosy picture of entrepreneurship there are several of episodes where the point is if you dont want to deal with this maybe business ownership isnt for you.  Following are my notes many of which are taken from the books One Minute Insights.  Notes  We become the average of the 5 people we most closely associate with so spend time with smart and successful people.  You never need to cheat to win.  Youll be the same every year except for the people you meet and the books you read.  You can get what you want in life if you help other people get what they want.  Its not who you know that counts its who knows you and what they think of you.  Take care of your numbers and your numbers will take care of you.  Identify what youre passionate about and find ways to do more of it.  On the entrepreneurial path few people come into your life without a reason.  Four Tips for Success  1. Sales must exceed expenses  2. Collect your bills  3. Take care of your customers  4. Take care of your people (employees)  Costcutting is negative. Think positive earn more by creating new sources of revenue that dont directly rely on your work (sell products earn commissions or royalties etc.)  Take advantage of Moments of Truth  those times when a customer gets an impression from your company.  Soar like an eagle dont quack like a duck. Eagles take initiative and provide great customer service but ducks act helpless by citing policy and limitations.  Employees want to be partners not subordinates.  Help your employees win rather than rating and berating.  Manage by daily coaching.  Success isnt just having a successful career its having a great life. Maintain a worklife balance.  Dont rush into things patiently implement a solid business strategy.  Passion   Play to your passion  do what you love   Find people to pay for your passion  need money to make it a business   Plus your passion  find new income streams based off what youre already passionate about   Pass on the prosperity  share money time and talents;Kenneth H.

1087;2287683;2;50548;;The Aeneid is a Latin epic poem written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC that tells the legendary story of Aeneas a Trojan who travelled to Italy where he became the ancestor of the Romans. It comprises 9896 lines in dactylic hexameter.[1] The first six of the poems twelve books tell the story of Aeneass wanderings from Troy to Italy and the poems second half tells of the Trojans ultimately victorious war upon the Latins under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The hero Aeneas was already known to GrecoRoman legend and myth having been a character in the Iliad composed in the 8th century BC. Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneass wanderings his vague association with the foundation of Rome and a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous pietas and fashioned this into a compelling founding myth or national epic that at once tied Rome to the legends of Troy explained the Punic wars glorified traditional Roman virtues and legitimized the JulioClaudian dynasty as descendants of the founders heroes and gods of Rome and Troy.;425;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1439857667m2287683.jpg;The Aeneid;poetry;As a fan of GrecoRoman mythology I thought Id like this story. Maybe it was just the particular translation but I didnt enjoy it nearly as much as The Iliad and The Odyssey. It takes place after the Trojan War recounting the story of Aeneas a Trojan who travels to Italy and becomes the ancestor of the Romans. Later he leads the Trojans against the Latins. The story is full of violent bloody fights and you get a real sense of the chaos of ancient battles.  It includes many themes common to GrecoRoman stories including honor heroism and fate. The gods play major roles in the story interfering in each others plans and in human affairs. The humans frequently appeal to their patron gods. During a single combat scene JoveZeus hangs life and death in a scale to determine the fate of one of the combatants.  I liked Aeneas visit to Hades where he talks to the shades of dead heroes. I also liked the mythical tale of Romes founding including the wolf suckling Romes twin founders Romulus and Remus.  I listened to the free Librivox audiobook of the translation by John Dryden.;Virgil John Dryden

Friedmans The World Is Flat A Brief History of the TwentyFirst Century and am interested in environmental and energy science. I was disappointed however by the time I finished the book.  Friedman explains the current state of the planet as hot (due to global warming) flat (middle class growth due to globalization) and crowded (rapidly increasing in population). He then describes some of the historical and political events that have led to this present state and what we can do to fix these problems starting right now.  A basic summary of the book is found in the first chapter Making America the worlds greenest country is not a selfless act of charity or naive moral indulgence. It is now a core national security and economic interest.  I found myself nodding off in the chapters that described the politics of the national and international environmental movements. However I really enjoyed Friedmans vision of an Energy Internet a national network linking American buildings and transportation to make them smarter about energy generation and consumption.;Thomas L.

1090;2527900;5;50548;0300122233;Every day we make decisions on topics ranging from personal investments to schools for our children to the meals we eat to the causes we champion. Unfortunately we often choose poorly. The reason the authors explain is that being human we all are susceptible to various biases that can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy we often make bad decisions involving education personal finance health care mortgages and credit cards the family and even the planet itself.Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world one that takes our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think we can design choice environments that make it easier for people to choose what is best for themselves their families and their society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects of life Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful choice architecture can be established to nudge us in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of choice. Nudgeoffers a unique new takefrom neither the left nor the righton many hotbutton issues for individuals and governments alike. This is one of the most engaging and provocative books to come along in many years.;304;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1328828013m2527900.jpg;Nudge Improving Decisions About Health Wealth and Happiness;nonfiction;This book opened my eyes to how humans make decisions and how easily they can be influenced by their peers and by the way choices are presented to them. Through engaging research and entertaining anecdotes it shows how to architect choices to nudge people towards certain decisions. The authors call this libertarian paternalism because it uses incentives to motivate desired behavior rather than using command and control measures like laws and bans. I highly recommend this book for its practical insight into behavioral psychology and behavioral economics.  In an ideal world people would have the time knowledge and motivation to make the perfect choices. In reality humans are irrational emotional ignorant apathetic or downright lazy so simply providing as many choices as possible rarely works. Libertarian paternalism strikes a balance between freedom of choice and incentivizing behavior.  I read this book because it was listed in .net Magazines The top 25 books for web designers and developers. I picked up a few ideas to use when creating websites for my web design business OptimWise use incentives to nudge users in certain directions provide good default options and gracefully handle user errors.  The authors explain that humans have automatic and reactive systems the automatic system is the subconscious emotional gut instinct while the reactive system is the intellectual conscious. Nudges help the reactive system overpower the automatic system.  The authors use liberal paternalism to advocate specific policies for public and private institutions dealing with topics in personal finance (saving retirement debt mortgages) health care education and politics. They also address the ethical issues of choice architecture.  I love personal finance so I especially liked seeing how nudges can lead to better retirement saving and investing. The authors show how something as simple as automatic enrollment in retirement plans results in a significant increase in participation.  I liked the RECAP (Record Evaluate and Compare Alternative Prices) concept which says vendors and service providers should give consumers a statement of the costs associated with different hypothetical patterns of service usage to help them make informed choices about things like electricity and gas consumption.  I liked the authors idea that people should be able to waive the right to sue for medical malpractice in exchange for lower medical costs. Im not sure how I feel about their proposal to privatize marriage they say this would give religious organizations the freedom to set rules about homosexuality divorce etc. while allowing the government to honor civil unions with benefits.  6 principles of good choice architecture   iNcentives motivate behavior with incentives   Understand mappings show the outcomes that will result from the choices   Defaults provide default options   Give feedback show people the effect their choices are having   Expect error make choices foolproof   Structure complex choices present complex choices in easily understood ways  Miscellaneous notes   The more you ask for the more you get.

Their physically and mentally fatiguing struggle for survival named the Hunger Games is televised to entertain the comfortable citizens of the Capitol and intimidate the oppressed residents of its districts.  The story is told from the firstperson perspective of Katniss a teenage girl in the Hunger Games. You read her thoughts and opinions as well as her descriptions of the action taking place around her. I liked watching her try to decipher the motives of Peeta Haymitch and the Gamemakers. I kept secondguessing most of the characters wondering if they were trying to help or harm Katniss. It was interesting to see Katniss try figuring out the effect that her performance in the arena was making on the Capitol audience and her family and friends at home.  The descriptions of the people places and emotions are vivid and there are many flashback scenes from Katniss past that provide context to her thoughts and actions in the arena. Characters such as Effie Trinket Haymitch and Rue were memorable and I found myself actually caring what happened to Katniss which doesnt always happen in fiction.  The action and cliffhangers make this quite pageturner. The author expertly weaves the primary story of Katniss struggles in the arena with the secondary story of her sorting out her romantic feelings for Peeta and Gabe.

The story contains almost no humor or other compelling qualities Id describe it as fairly lifeless. I found I simply didnt care about Erasmas or the other characters. I cant believe this book ranked 85 on NPRs Top 100 ScienceFiction Fantasy Books. Its only redeeming value is that it provides some thoughtprovoking insights into the interaction of science technology and religion in society.  I liked Cryptonomicon (see my review) so I was especially disappointed by this one. Stephenson is known for his weak endings but the finale was even more anticlimactic than I was anticipating. The story is set in an alien world so Stephenson invented a new vocabulary for it. Although this added realism to the story it was distracting to have to keep referencing words in the glossary especially near the beginning of the book. There are a few action scenes that are page turners. There are some surprises and twists and hints at deeper mysteries but they never materialize.

1094;3220405;2;50548;0765304961;At first Ender believed that they would bring him back to Earth as soon as things quieted down. But things were quiet now had been quiet for a year and it was plain to him now that they would not bring him back at all that he was much more useful as a name and a story than he would ever be as an inconvenient fleshandblood person.At the close of Enders Game Andrew Wiggincalled Ender by everyoneknows that he cannot live on Earth. He has become far more than just a boy who won a game He is the Savior of Earth a hero a military genius whose allegiance is sought by every nation of the newly shattered Earth Hegemony.He is offered the choice of living under the Hegemons control a pawn in his brother Peters political games. Or he can join the colony ships and go out to settle one of the new worlds won in the war.The story of those years on the colony worlds has never been told...until now.The voyage was long. By the end of it Val had finished the first volume of her history of the bugger wars and transmitted it by ansible under Demosthenes name back to Earth and Ender had won something better than the adulation of the passengers. They knew him now and he had won their love and their respect.Ender was twelve when he chose to leave his home world and begin the long relativistic journey out to the colonies. With him went his sister Valentine and the core of the artificial intelligence that would become Jane. He wrote The Hive Queen and The Hegemon and his sister wrote The Speaker for the Dead.He served as governor of his first colony world but now Ender is on the move looking for a planet where the hive queens might be reestablished.What he finds in the Ganges colony is more than he bargained fora resentful governor who caused a devastating war on Earth and a brilliant young colonist who is out to destroy him starting with his reputation and ending perhaps with his life.;369;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Ender in Exile (Enders Saga 1.2);fiction;Ill admit that I had high expectations for this book since I loved the other Enders Game series books Ive read Enders Game Speaker for the Dead Xenocide and Children of the Mind. While I did enjoy the book for the additional history and details it provides I cant think of anything remarkable it contributed to the Ender storyline.  Although its called a direct sequel to Enders Game most of this book actually takes place between chapters 14 (Enders victory) and 15 (Ender on a colony world) of Enders Game. Enders discovery of the playground on the colony world recorded in chapter 15 of Enders Game occurs more than threequarters of the way through this book. This book actually starts with the end of the Second Formic War with Ender on Eros. It records the thoughts and conversations of Enders family on Earth (parents Peter and Valentine) concerning whether he should return home.  The book contains expanded details of Graffs court martial Enders voyage to his first colony world Valentine authoring The Hive Queen Ender authoring The Hegemon and more examples of Enders understanding and empathy for buggers and humans.  At the end I still had questions  Whatever happened to Alessandra  What happened between Sel and Afraima  What communication did Ender have with his parents Only one letter from Ender to them is recorded even though Graff later refers to their ongoing conversations.  What conversations did Ender have with Peter Only vague mentions of ansible conversations that inspired Ender to write The Hegemon are recorded no dialog.  If youre a fan of the Enders Game series youll enjoy the book for the additional backstory it contains and it wont detract from the world you already know. Just dont expect it to make the same impact as the other books.;Orson Scott Card
1095;3228917;3;50548;0316017922;In this stunning new book Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of outliersthe best and the brightest the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question what makes highachievers differentHis answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like and too little attention to where they are from that is their culture their family their generation and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires what it takes to be a great soccer player why Asians are good at math and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.;309;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1344266315m3228917.jpg;Outliers The Story of Success;nonfiction;This book changed my perspective on achievement and success. Gladwell posits that success depends not on extraordinary talent but extraordinary opportunities. He makes a compelling case that theres no such thing as a selfmade man but that were all products of our cultural legacy community and advantages available to us. I especially liked the recurring theme that successful people consistently work harder than their peers their achievement is a function of their persistence not their talent.  The book is mostly stories and anecdotes sprinkled throughout with statistics and analyses. Gladwell is a longwinded storyteller and takes his time getting to the point. I lowered my rating of the book because of this. I was bored silly by the lengthy chapter on how airplane miscommunications and crashes can be attributed to cultural legacies regarding respect for authority and assertiveness. But as a technologist I liked the story of how Bill Gates unique opportunities to practice programming during his formative years led him to Microsoft fame and fortune.  Gladwell sets out to prove that (to paraphrase) success arises from the steady accumulation of advantages when and where you were born what your parents did for a living and the circumstances of your upbringing. Our lives are a web of advantages and disadvantages whether deserved or undeserved. Successful people are those in the right place at the right time who jump on the opportunities they have to work hard.  Gladwell succinctly summarizes the book near the end as follows  Success follows a predictable course. Its not the brightest who succeed. Nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own. Its a gift the successful are those who have been given opportunities and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.  I liked the point that as long as you have a base level of talent in an area your success depends on practice. It takes about 10000 hours of practice to attain expertise which usually takes about 10 years. Also the law of diminishing returns applies to intelligence once you have enough it ceases to provide an advantage.  Gladwell provides interesting insight into such questions as why Asians excel at math and why American schoolchildren lag academically. He says that Asian numbering systems (especially Chinese) are more intuitive than Western systems and their historical cultural legacies of hard work give Asians advantage over Westerners. He also shows the detrimental effects of short school days and summer vacations on American schoolchildren because they spend less time practicing skills and more time forgetting.;Malcolm Gladwell
1096;3255666;1;50548;0767928822;The year was 1957 the month September and I had just turned eight years old. Dwight Eisenhower was President but in my life it was the diminutive intense Sister Mary Lurana who ruled at least in the thirdgrade class where I was held captive. For reasons you will soon understand my parents had remanded me to the penal institution of St. Brigids School in Westbury New York a cruel and unusual punishment if there ever was one.Already I had barely survived my first two years at St. Brigids because I was well a little nitwit. Not satisfied with memorizing the Baltimore Catechisms fine prose which featured passages like God made me to show his goodness and to make me happy with him in heaven I was constantly annoying my classmates and of course the nononsense Sister Lurana. With sixty overactive students in her class she was understandably short on patience. For survival she had also become quick on the draw.Then it happened. One day I blurted out some dumb remark and Sister Lurana was on me like a panther. Her black habit blocked out all distractions as she leaned down looked me in the eye and uttered words I have never forgotten William you are a bold fresh piece of humanity.And she was deadon.One day in 1957 in the thirdgrade classroom of St. Brigids parochial school an exasperated Sister Mary Lurana bent over a restless young William OReilly and said William you are a bold fresh piece of humanity. Little did she know that she was early in his career as a troublemaker defining the essence of Bill OReilly and providing him with the title of his brash and entertaining issuesbased memoir.And this time its personal. In his most intimate book yet OReilly goes back in time to examine the people places and experiences that launched him on his journey from workingclass kid to immensely influential television personality and bestselling author. Readers will learn how his traditional outlook was formed in the crucible of his family his neighborhood his church and his schools and how his views on Americas proper role in the world emerged from covering four wars on five continents over threeplus decades as a news correspondent. What will delight his numerous fans and surprise many others is the humor and selfdeprecation with which he handles one of his core subjects himself and just how OReilly became OReilly.;256;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;A Bold Fresh Piece of Humanity;nonfiction;I know very little about Bill OReilly and have only seen his show when channel surfing. I only read this book because someone asked me to and I wish I hadnt. Throughout the book OReilly refers to himself as the bold fresh guy rather than using personal pronouns I and me. This got pretty annoying after the 20th time.  OReilly basically tells his life story explaining how events in his childhood shaped his attitudes and personality today. That may be interesting for a fan but I wasnt into it. Here are some of the topics he covers  People should be selfreliant and cant look to the government or others for handouts.  Anyone who deliberately harms another human is evil. Evil people usually are that way by nature and cant be rehabilitated.  He talks extensively about his Catholic upbringing and experiences at Catholic schools and how he consciously decided to remain Catholic.  He records how events and friends in his youth molded him into the man he is today.  People should be held accountable for their actions.  He includes firsthand accounts of the culture during his early life including the antiVietnam movement pot smoking and several presidential elections.  He talks about his quest for fairness being his defining characteristic hes always standing up to the big guy for the sake of the little guy. He says thats what hes done throughout life and still does with his cable TV show.;Bill OReilly

Used extensively by individual writers as well as high school and college students of writing it has conveyed the principles of English style to millions of readers. This new deluxe edition makes the perfect gift for writers of any age and ability level. Fifty Years of Acclaim for The Elements of Style by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White I first read Elements of Style during the summer before I went off to Exeter and I still direct my students at Harvard to their definition about the difference between that and which. It is the Bible for good clear writing.  Henry Louis Gates Jr. For writers of all kinds and sizes the world begins and ends with Strunk and Whites Elements of Style. Only something to actually write about trumps the list of what is required to put words together in some kind of coherent way. I treasure its presence in my life and salute its fifty years of glory and accomplishment.  Jim Lehrer The Elements of Style remains an unwavering beacon of light in these grammatically troubled times. I would be lost without it.  Ann Patchett To the extent I know how to write clearly at all I probably taught myself while I was teaching others  seventh graders in Flint Michigan in 1967. I taught them with a copy of Strunk  White lying in full view on my desk sort of in the way the Gideons leave Bibles in cheap hotel rooms as a way of saying to the hapless inhabitant In case your reckless ways should strand you here theres help. SW doesnt really teach you how to write it just tantalizingly reminds you that theres an orderly way to go about it that claritys ever your ideal but  really  its all going to be up to you.  Richard Ford The Elements of Style never seems to go out of date. Its counsel is sound and funny wise and unpretentious. And while its precepts are a foundation of direct communication Strunk and White do not insist on a way of writing beyond clear expression. The rest is up to the imagination the intelligence within.  David Remnick editor of The New Yorker Its the toughnessthe irreverence and implicit laughterthat attracted me to the little book when I was seventeen. I fell in love with Strunk  Whites loathing for cant and bloviation the ruthless cutting of crap jargon and extra words. For me that skeptical directness included a tacit permission by The Elements of Style to break its rules on occasion an alloy of generosity in the blade a grace I still admire and still learn from.  Robert Pinsky In the quest for clarity one can have no better guides than Strunk and White. For me their book has been invaluable and remains essential.  Dan Rather Eschew surplusage A perfect book. Jonathan Lethem Not until I started teaching writing and I reread The Elements of Style did I realize that most everything I would be teaching young writers and everything I would be learning myself as a writer was contained between the covers of this slim elegant wise little book.  Julia Alvarez Strunk and White seared their way into my brain long ago and I benefit from them daily.  Steven J. Dubner coauthor of Freakonomics Since high school I have kept a copy of this book handy. That should be unnecessary. I should by now have fully internalized The Elements of Style. But sometimes I get entangled in a paragraph that refuses to be clear brief bold. I dip back into The Elements of Style and am refreshed. After Scott Simon interviewed me on NPR about whether the word email needs a hyphen (yes it does) some listeners including friends of mine wondered why I had answered in the affirmative when asked in passing Are you a drunken white man Those listeners misheard. Strunk and White man was what Scott said.  Roy Blount Jr. Strunk  Whitewritings goodnatured law firmstill contains enough sparkling good sense to clean up the whole bloviating blogosphere.  Thomas Mallon I used Strunk  thats what we called it Strunk  as a student at Berkeley fifty years ago. I didnt know that it was new and that we were the first generation to be educated in The Elements of Style. I got a firm foundation in the English language learned to write basically and could depict the realistic world. Then I was able to become an impressionist and expressionist.  Maxine Hong Kingston Strunk and Whites gigantic little book must be the most readable advice on writing ever written. Side by side with Roget Shakespeare the Bible and a dictionary its an essential for every writers shelf.  X.J. Kennedy With what joy I welcome the fiftieth anniversary of The Elements of Style. I am greatly indebted to this book for the invaluable help it has given me all these years.  Horton Foote Elegant droll and perfectly proportioned and like your favorite aunt strict but affectionate. And like your favorite aunt full of optimism You can and will be a better writer There has never been a better briefer or more loved book about the art and craft of communicating.  Susan Orlean This book is an essential tool. It has been of great use to me and is probably responsible for my best writing. I owe my success to Strunk and White only the mistakes are mine.  Ben Affleck in O the Oprah Magazine This book is a wonderful example of teaching by example. Not only does it recommend clear and concise writing it demonstrates it. Written in the style of a friend offering help it is a godsend to anyone wanting to put words on paper. Thank you Messieurs Strunk and White. And Happy Anniversary Elements of Style.  S.E. Hinton When I began to have ... I wouldnt say arguments but conversations in my mind with Strunk and White about a few of their rules and principles I knew I was coming into my own. If only they were still here to talk things over No doubt their side of the exchange would be kindly put wellinformed and wise. Theyd probably help me with my side of it. What more could one want from writers reaching out to help other writers  Barbara Wallraff language columnist for The Atlantic I dont believe there is a serious writer alive who doesnt have a worn copy of Strunk  Whiteon his or her bookshelf.  Mignon Fogarty author of Grammar Girls Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing This little book has inspired hundreds of thousands of people to write better  partly by precept and partly by example. It continues to influence more writers than any other. Its a force for good in the world.  Bryan A. Garner author of Garners Modern American Usage I can think of no better guide to good writing and I always think of this little classic with a warm heart. More importantly I revisit its pages often. Its the one essential book on writing.  Jay Parini author of Why Poetry Matters Clarity and simplicity have always been the goals and this book shows the way. It has always been a lighthouse in the dark and stormy night of student prose of all of our prose.  Ron Carlson The only rules you are ever going to get from me are all in Strunk and White. Ursula K. Le Guin from Steering the Craft  [The Elements of Style is] a book to which I return from time to time the way I periodically reread Shakespeare. I always discover something new settle a question that has been puzzling me or learn a principle of usage that I have been pretending to know a pretense that has resulted in inconsistency and in the sort of errors from which I can only pray some saintly copy editor will save me.  Francine Prose from Reading Like A Writer ...still a little book small enough and important enough to carry in your pocket as I carry mine.  Charles Osgood Almost every writer has a Strunk and White story. One journalism professor spends the first two weeks of school forcing his students to memorize the book. A top editor at a major paper buys copies at yard sales to distribute to her writers and interns. It has even caused love affairs. . . . Could its greatness be any more clear  Jesse Sheidlower American Editor of the Oxford English Dictionary on NPR If the English language is one of the finest homes ever devised for the human spirit Elements is the best guided house tour weve got. David Gelernter The Wall Street Journal ...Should be the daily companion of anyone who writes for a living and for that matter anyone who writes at all. Jonathan Yardley  Greensboro (N.C.) Daily News No book in shorter space with fewer words will help any writer more than this persistent little volume.  Herbert A. Kenny The Boston Globe Buy it study it enjoy it. Its as timeless as a book can be in our age of volubility.  Charles Poore The New York Times White is one of the best stylists and most lucid minds in this country. What he says and his way of saying it are equally rewarding.  Edmund Fuller The Wall Street JournalIf you have any young friends who aspire to become writers the second greatest favor you can do them is to present them with copies of The Elements of Style. The first greatest of course is to shoot them now while theyre happy.  Dorothy Parker Esquire;105;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;The Elements of Style;nonfiction;A classic on writing well including guidelines on grammar and usage as well writing with style. Its clear with plenty of examples (some humorous).  I agree with the author that If every word or device that achieved currency [popular use] were immediately authenticated simply on the ground of popularity the language would be as chaotic as a ball game with no foul lines.  My notes follow.  Elementary Rules of Usage  For the possessive singular of nouns by adding s. Do this even when word ends with s.  Elementary Principles of Composition  Instead of using not express the thought in positive form.  Save would should could may might can for situations involving real uncertainty. Otherwise use will shall.  In summarizing a poem story or novel use present tense or past if it seems more natural.  Words and Expressions Commonly Misused  Comprise means includes. A zoo comprises animals animals constitute a zoo.  Currently is usually redundant.  Use different from not different than.  Enormity means monstrous wickedness not bigness.  Avoid ongoing since its usually superfluous.  Avoid one of the most which doesnt add anything.  To avoid awkward he or she use plural rather than singular or eliminate the pronoun or use 3rd person rather than 2nd.  Verbal sometimes means word for word and may refer to writing. Oral limits the meaning to speech. Oral agreement is more precise than verbal agreement.  Avoid using while instead of and but although. Only use while when things are happening concurrently.  An Approach to Style  Write with nouns and verbs not adjectives and adverbs. Nouns and verbs give good writing its toughness and color.  Avoid qualifiers rather very little pretty.;William Strunk Jr. E.B. White

Because healthy food can be expensive I liked the many moneysaving tips. The book is more focused on the foods than the nutritional science behind their recommendations but there are plenty of short tips and explanations. Its packed with photos of food so read on an empty stomach at your peril  I skipped through a few of the sections such as many snacks candy frozen meals and energy drinks since I rarely if ever consume those. The book recommends against eating most of these things regularly but points out the healthier lesseroftwoevils options if you must indulge.  The books very helpful for decoding marketing labels and ingredients to help you recognize whats healthy. The general advice the simpler the food and the fewer the ingredients the better. Choose natural over artificial ingredients.  Notes  Save money by buying canned storebrand fruits and vegetables. Watch out for added sugar and sodium.  For canned meat and fish choose packed in water not oil.  Steam vegetables instead of boiling them.  Avoid pickles they come from nutritionally weak cucumbers and are packed with sodium.

Its a logical stepbystep practical handbook for financial success specially written for twentysomethings. It was better than the personal finance books Ive read by Eric Tyson Andrew Tobias Dave Ramsey Suze Orman and Robert Kiyosaki. See my Finance shelf on Goodreads for my reviews of those books.  Sethi gives advice on automatically enabling yourself to save invest and spend  enjoying it not feeling guilty...because youre spending only what you have. His main point automate your finances so you effortlessly save and invest leaving you money to spend on things you love without feeling guilty. Automatic saving and investing helps overcome psychological barriers and laziness.  In addition to his emphasis on automation I agreed with Sethis recommendation for longterm passive buyandhold investing instead of speculative markettiming investing. I also liked Sethis 85 Percent Solution which states that its better to act and get it 85 right than to do 0 sometimes good enough is good enough and its always better than doing nothing.  Another good message is spend extravagantly on the things you love and cut costs mercilessly on the things you dont. Thats valuable because everyone defines being rich differently and its not all about money. Money is just the tool we use to acquire the material possessions and experiences we want. Thats the difference between being cheap and being frugal being cheap is trying to cut spending on everything and being frugal is cutting costs on the things you dont care about so that you can splurge on the things you do.  I liked the concept of making a Conscious Spending Plan instead of a budget. Almost no one actually makes a budget and even fewer follow it. Instead consciously decide how youll spend your money. I especially like this idea of guiltfree spending because too often the recommendation is to limit all spending. But people in their 20s want to live it up not sit at home and pinch every penny The Conscious Spending Plan lets you spend a certain percentage of your money on whatever you want without feeling guilty since youre paying yourself and your bills first.  The book is written in the form of a 6week action plan. Each chapter describes the tasks and reasoning behind them and ends with a checklist of steps to take. Here are the weeks  Week 1 Credit Cards. Check your credit pick a good credit card set up automatic payments pay off debt.  Week 2 Bank Accounts. Open or assess your checking account open and fund a highinterest savings account.  Week 3 Investing Accounts. Open a 401(k) make a plan to pay off debt open a Roth IRA and set up automatic payment.  Week 4 Conscious Spending. Create a Conscious Spending Plan track spending and cut in the right places.  Week 5 Automatic Money Flows. List and link accounts then set up an Automatic Money Flow to automatically fund the 4 categories of your Conscious Spending Plan.  Week 6 Investing Choices. Figure out your investing style research investments and buy funds.  The book gives a fairly indepth explanation of the concepts and fundamentals of personal finance but also contains plenty of examples of actual bank accounts and funds. There are many references to the 2008 recession and other current events so those parts of the book wont age well.  This is my new 1 recommendation for anyone seeking personal finance advice.

He then returns to his own country and lives to old age before dying in a vivid fight against a dragon.The poem is about encountering the monstrous defeating it and then having to live on in the exhausted aftermath. In the contours of this story at once remote and uncannily familiar at the end of the twentieth century Seamus Heaney finds a resonance that summons power to the poetry from deep beneath its surface.While an abridgment of Heaneys full translation of Beowulf Heaney prepared this abridgment himself to read for the BBC program from which this recording is taken.;0;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Beowulf;fiction;I didnt find the story compelling but I attribute that mostly to the difficulty I had understanding the archaic language. I listened to it as an audiobook and I had to concentrate just to understand what was happening easy listening its not. I listened to it because its a popular ancient text and it influenced one of my favorite authors J.R.R. Tolkien.  The story describes Beowulfs battles with the monster Grendel Grendels mother and a dragon. You get a feel for an AngloSaxon warriors life with the descriptions of the warriors kings weapons treasures buildings and battles.  I didnt expect the Christian content. There are several mentions of Cain Abel God Heaven and Hell. The warriors credit God with their victories.

Overall my thoughts on this book are the same as that one so see that review. In this book only 9 or so of the 31 questions deals directly with evolution (biological geological or cosmological). The others focus on biblical interpretation and application theological questions biblical historicity and inerrancy and culturalmoral implications.  I liked the chapter that shows how geological processes such as lithification of sedimentary layers erosion fossilization and coal formation can happen rapidly and dont require millions of years. See Arent Millions of Years Required for Geological Processes  I found the history of the canon of Scripture interesting and also liked Isnt the Bible Full of Contradictions  Perhaps I misunderstand but it seems that sometimes these books use the same uniformitarian assumptions they call invalid. They claim that rates (for values such as lightspeed radioactive decay and genetic mutation) may have changed in the past rendering modern measurements inaccurate yet they use uniformitarian rates to defend creationism in other instances (lunar recession weakening of Earths magnetic field and comet destruction).  You can read the entire book online.  Fossil record  ...in a very general way the order of fossil succession in the geologic record would reflect the successive burial of these pre Flood biological communities as the Flood waters rose up onto the continents. Distinct faunal stratigraphic horizons can be explained by water sorting simpler (spherical and undifferentiated) organisms first and others in order of increasing structural complexity.  Sediment beds tend to contain from lowest to highest marine vertebrates amphibians reptiles and finally birds and mammals. The Flood can explain this order  1. Increasing mobility and therefore increasing ability to postpone inundation and burial  2. Decreasing density and other hydrodynamic factors which would tend to promote later burial and  3. Increasing elevation of habitat and therefore time required for the Flood waters to rise and advance to overtake them.  See Doesnt the Order of Fossils in the Rock Record Favor Long Ages  Biblical historicity and inerrancy  Creationists cant argue for creation without the Bible. The Bible reveals major events (Creation Fall Flood Babel etc.) that enable interpretation of present facts.  The questioning of the historicity of Genesis wasnt due to a reexamination of Scripture but rather to match secularevolutionary views. See Are Biblical Creationists Divisive  If the writer of Genesis was so careless as to omit over 85 percent of the generations in Genesis 11 why did he waste time giving us the information in the first place What purpose would it serve since it would be so inaccurate See Are There Gaps in the Genesis Genealogies  This book recommends reading Alleged Discrepancies of the Bible by John Haley for more details on alleged discrepancies. See Isnt the Bible Full of Contradictions  Biblical canon  Jesus and the apostles didnt quote from the Apocrypha even though they used the Septuagint which contained the Apocrypha (at the end). Josephus didnt consider the Apocrypha part of Scripture. See Why 66  Extrabiblical writings and missing gospels arent consistent with canonical Scripture and should be rejected.

1104;6117055;4;50548;059306173X;Charles Darwins masterpiece On the Origin of Species shook society to its core on publication in 1859. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke but he would surely have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians yet millions of people continue to question its veracity.In The Greatest Show on EarthRichard Dawkins takes on creationists including followers of Intelligent Design and all those who question the fact of evolution through natural selection. Like a detective arriving on the scene of a crime he sifts through fascinating layers of scientific facts and disciplines to build a castiron case from the living examples of natural selection in birds and insects the time clocks of trees and radioactive dating that calibrate a timescale for evolution the fossil record and the traces of our earliest ancestors to confirmation from molecular biology and genetics. All of this and much more bears witness to the truth of evolution.The Greatest Show on Earthcomes at a critical time systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is now flourishing as never before especially in America. In Britain and elsewhere in the world teachers witness insidious attempts to undermine the status of science in their classrooms. Richard Dawkins provides unequivocal evidence that boldly and comprehensively rebuts such nonsense. At the same time he shares with us his palpable love of the natural world and the essential role that science plays in its interpretation. Written with elegance wit and passion it is hardhitting absorbing and totally convincing.;470;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1302127919m6117055.jpg;The Greatest Show on Earth The Evidence for Evolution;nonfiction;Dawkins makes an evidencebased case for evolution against creationists and Intelligent Design advocates whom he calls history deniers. The book is written for laypeople but provides enough scientific detail to make his points. This book augmented my understanding of how natural selection (which I accept) leads to evolution (which I accept to an extent I dont accept that theres a single tree of life). I read it because Im a creationist and wanted to increase my familiarity with the arguments against creationism. This book did just that and prompted further questions. My rating is based on the fact that I found the book informative and interesting not because I agree with all its contents.  My main complaint is that Dawkins mocks creationists (mostly Christians but he mentions Muslims too) for their religious beliefs but but he overlooks key beliefs that shape their understanding of life such as that God created the universe in a mature state and that the Fall (humanitys fall into sin) negatively affected life on Earth. Obviously Dawkins would at such beliefs my point is simply that if hes going to attack a belief system he should represent it accurately. Surprisingly Dawkins doesnt bash his opponents nearly as hard in this book as he does in The God Delusion (my review).  Dawkins points out apparent faults in modern creatures saying eyes and nerves sperm tubes sinuses and backs are poorly designed... and calls the human eye the design of a complete idiot. He jokes about unintelligent design. He later points to pain and suffering as evidence for the lack of an intelligent designer (at least a beneficent one) joking that God made cheetahs to be killing machines. Such arguments about faulty designs and suffering ignore the belief that life on Earth was negatively altered by the curse that resulted from humanitys fall into sin. All creatures that have ever existed since the Fall are fundamentally different from Gods original creations which He called good.  Genesis 317ff records changes such as thorns and thistles and presumably other unpleasant things that came about as a consequence of humanitys fall into sin. See also Romans 818ff. God didnt create any creatures as killing machines because death wasnt part of the original creation.  Dawkins also mocks creationists for believing that all modern species were created by God. I dont believe that the Bible teaches or requires such a belief Genesis doesnt record all the creatures that were originally created it simply lists broad kinds (plants trees birds creatures of the sea wild animals etc.). Even for those creatures that are named we dont know their species or anything about their genomes. Humans are named as an original creation (Genesis 327) unique from the other creatures but we dont know how much humans have changed from that original design after passing through the Fall and generations of genetic change.  I dont recall Dawkins addressing the belief that God created a mature and fullyfunctioning universe which would render longterm dating methods inaccurate (look up the Appearance of Age Theory). This is probably because he considers such a belief preposterous.  At one point Dawkins uses the development of the human embryo in the womb to show that its not difficult for a single cell to become a human and uses this to defend the theory that humans evolved from singlecelled organisms. I found this to be a stretch since a human zygote contains already contains the genetic information necessary for the construction of the human body.  Dawkins says we have no evidence about the origin of life only hypotheses.  Below are my notes from the book without any commentary from me. Below that are the questions this book raised in my mind.  Notes   Evolutionary change is too slow for us to notice like the movement of tectonic plates.   In the subtitle to On the Origin of Species which is The preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life race means creatures possessing a certain allele not races within humanity.   Natural selection means that every gene pool in every species tends to become filled with genes for making superior equipment for survival and reproduction.   Artificial selection is not just an analogy for natural selection...[it] constitutes a true experimental...test of the hypothesis that selection causes evolutionary change.   Natural selection doesnt lead to perfection in all areas. Perfection in one department must be bought in the form of a sacrifice in another department. Creatures have limited resources and theres no such thing as a free lunch.   Not all genes necessarily have survival value. Some are pleiotropically linked to genes that do have survival value.   No fossil remotely resembling a mammal has been found in Devonian rock or any older stratum. No trilobites are found above the Permian and no dinosaurs above the Cretaceous.   Several different radioactive clocks converge on the age of Earth at 4.6 billion years.   Natural selection often acts to shift the balance of existing variation rather than waiting for key mutations to turn up.   In Richard Lenskis experiments new information entered the E. coli genome the ability to feed on citrate.   Bacteria have evolved resistance to almost every antibiotic developed since World War II.   No modern species is descended from any other modern species they simply share ancestors. Humans arent descended from monkeys they share a common ancestor.   Every creature that has ever been born would have been classified...as...exactly the same species as its parents and its children. Its only with hindsight that classification into distinct species genera etc. becomes possible.   Natural selection doesnt need to understand why a genetic change has a certain consequence...If that consequence affects survival the changed gene itself will stand or fall in the competition to dominate the gene pool.   The development of the embryo and ultimately of the adult is achieved by local rules implemented by cells interacting with other cells on a local basis...There is no overall plan of development no blueprint...no architect.   Speciation occurs when isolated gene pools become too different for combined genomes to produce fertile offspring.   Genetic comparisons of many species indicate a single tree of life.   Fixation is when a new mutation increases to 100 (or nearly) in a gene pool. By comparing the genes that have become fixed in two species we can estimate how recently they split apart.   Most mutations are disadvantageous...Natural selection promptly penalizes the bad mutations. However depending on environment or other factors deleterious mutations are not penalized and spreads. Example blind eyes in troglobites (creatures that live in total darkness).   Evolution doesnt contradict the Second Law of Thermodynamics (entropy increases in an isolated system) because the Sun feeds energy into Earths systems.

Like the first book nearly every chapter ends with a cliffhanger so its difficult to put down. I read the final chapters in one sitting because of the plot twists and surprises.  In this book Katniss discovers that shes part of something larger than her own defiance of the Capitol. The other districts are more prominently featured and events occur on a grander scale. Katniss tries to uncover the truth behind rumors of an underground resistance in the districts while hoping her family doesnt lose the comforts that she won by her victory in The Hunger Games.  The books present tense made me feel like I was experiencing the story in realtime. As in The Hunger Games Katniss internal dialog is a major feature. Her morbid dark sense of humor is an entertaining contrast to the actionpacked narrative. I enjoyed seeing her secondguess the motives of the various residents of the Capitol and districts that she encounters. Of course the story would be incomplete without Katniss confused romantic feelings for Gale and Peeta.  Author Suzanne Collins has a knack for giving insights into characters by showcasing their behavior rather than describing them outright. For example at a Capitol party affluent attendees shamelessly binge and purge despite the rampant starvation in the districts. This single scene tells more about the Capitol residents than would several paragraphs explaining their motives and attitudes.  I really liked this book not quite as much as The Hunger Games but enough to put the 3rd book Mockingjay on my list.;Suzanne Collins

Every time they propose a reasonable explanation for some behavior you find yourself nodding in understanding. Then a page or 2 later they reveal an entirely different often contradictory explanation. You realize how complicated the study of human behavior and its causes really are.  I liked the section on altruism and learning how people practice pure and impure altruism in their lives using examples such as donating to charity or reporting crimes.  The section on global climate change was also good after presenting a lot of statistical data and predictions of the potential effects on the planet the authors describe several proposed solutions many of which seem farfetched at first but are apparently based on sound science. In this section the authors explained the positive and negative externalities of climaterelated factors such as waste management pollution and transportation.  Like the first book the authors are loyal to the hard facts of their studies rather than giving into the hype and hysteria often associated with theories about human behavior.

I saw the surprise revelation of Malakhs origin coming several chapters beforehand which took the wind out of the sails. The books end drags.  Im a devout Christian so I disagreed with the storys basic premise that humans have for thousands of years misunderstood the Bible and other religious texts.

He spends his new free time living on his terms which for him means traveling the world. He wants you to do the same and provides the motivation and action steps to do so. The basic message of this book take shortcuts.  In most cases those shortcuts involve working smarter. In a few instances however Ferriss promotes what I would consider questionable or unethical behavior (such as telling halftruths to your boss or others or taking advantage of loopholes in rules). Ferriss comes across as someone I could never fully trust and thus wouldnt want to emulate entirely.  Ferriss says that Becoming a member of the NR [New Rich] is not just about working smarter. Its about building a system to replace yourself. Ferriss calls this system Income Autopilot. He says the path to wealth and freedom is to own not run a business. An owner has people and systems do the work while someone running a business is another cog in the machine.  Ferriss advocates creating a product business that you can quickly scale through delegation and automation. He discourages service businesses because theyre not as easy to scale. He says that if you have a service business you should convert it into a product business by turning your services into information products like ebooks webinars audio recordings etc. I found this an interesting point because my web design company OptimWise is a service business and Im looking to maximize profits with the least effort.  One of Ferriss main ideas is that rather than postponing fun activities until retirement you should take several miniretirements that are weeks or months long throughout your working life. This book was part of the reason that I quit my 95 job to start OptimWise. I wanted the freedom of working when and where I wanted so that work fits around life not vice versa. I really liked The Parable of the Mexican Fisherman referenced in this book.  I really liked Ferriss advice about going on an information diet. Ive tried to follow his advice by frequently unsubscribing from email newsletters and RSS feeds. After reading this book the first time in 2008 I stopped reading the newspaper and news sites and replaced them with NPRs daily 5minute news summary podcast.  Ferriss advocates effectiveness in place of efficiency. He says to eliminate all the unnecessary busyness that takes up most of our time and focus on the tasks that actually matter.  Ferriss certainly presents an extreme example of the New Rich lifestyle. What if you love your job and have no desire to leave it This book is still worth reading for the lessons about prioritization and timemanagement.  Notes   DEAL Define Eliminate Automate Liberate.   People dont want to be millionaires. They want the millionaire lifestyle. You can have it without being a millionaire.   Effectiveness is more important than efficiency doing a few things effectively is better than doing many things efficiently.   The seeming lack of time is actually a lack of prioritization. Focus on the important.   Use the Pareto Principle and Parkinsons Law to limit the tasks you undertake.   Consume information only when the need is immediate and obvious. Use justintime learning.   Eliminate before you delegate.   Dont let people interrupt you. Force people to define their requests before you spend time on them. Empower others to act without interrupting you.   Batch routine tasks. Check email and phone messages only at predetermined times.   If you have a service business sell information products (ebooks audio video etc.) for 50200 (a price high enough to increase the perception of quality).;Timothy Ferriss

He used social media and online video (WineLibrary TV) to gain incredible exposure and propel his wine business to unprecedented success. Garys secret isnt social media however its his passion. Social media is just the tool he uses to share his passion and connect with others. As he states in chapter 9 the best marketing strategy ever is simple care.  The main premise is that life is too short to do work that you dont enjoy you need to follow your passion. Thanks to modern social media you can connect with others who share your passion no matter how obscure it is. Participate in the community around the topic youre passionate about and with time your personal brand will be valuable enough to monetize and do what you love full time.  Of course its everyones dream to follow their passion to do the work that doesnt even seem like work because they love it so much. Sadly only a small percentage of people are able to make a living that way. By following the advice and examples from the life of Gary and others in this book I really believe its possible to cash in on your passion.  I read this book to learn how to build my personal brand and promote OptimWise with social media. I feel like Ive gained a better understanding of the overall role of social media in branding and communitybuilding. Gary also motivated me to keep up my efforts warning that it takes a lot of time and hard work to see results.  Speaking of hard work Gary states several times that he spends hours a day online reading blogs tweets and forum posts and responding to email. He believes its necessary to put this much time into community participation and says theres plenty of time for it if you stay up until 2 or 3 AM. This is one place Garys being unrealistic most people are not able to function on so little sleep let alone have enough energy to crush it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone ready to stop working for The Man and start creating their personal brand. Gary doesnt just wax poetic about social media or his life story he provides practical tips to follow. Chapter 10 and the appendix contain checklists for building a personal brand and they walk you through identifying your passion creating your personal brand creating online accounts becoming part of the community and monetizing.  A great summary of the book comes from the end  True success  financial  personal and professional lies above all in loving your family working hard and living your passion. In telling your story. In authenticity hustle and patience. In caring fiercely about the big and the small stuff. In valuing legacy over currency.  Notes  Branding   You need to develop your personal brand regardless of your job or industry.   Use the Internet to build brand equity not just to sell.   Personal and professional brands are merging dont try to maintain separate personalities. Be honest trustworthy and transparent. Think of personal branding as a friendly lunch interview where you share both the personal and professional parts of your life.   Brand building is a marathon not a sprint. It can takes months or years to see results dont give up too quickly.  Content and community   Embrace your DNA (your passion what you were born to do) and create awesome content. People will find and follow you.   Storytelling is the most underrated skill in business. People want to be told whats good and valuable and that you can give them something not everyone can appreciate.   Great content results from using the right medium (text audio video) and the right topic (what youre passionate about and expert in told as a story).   The best business question of all time What can I do for you   Become a part of your topics community by finding and participating in online conversations.  Websites and social media   Your website should include calltoaction buttons to encourage people to connect with you and share buttons to share your content with their friends.   Treat your blog as your home and use social media to lead people to it.   Automatically post to multiple platforms using Ping.fm and TubeMogul.  Monetizing   Dont monetize until your brand has attention and stickiness and you have a community.   Monetize with advertising speaking affiliate programs retail selling articles and consulting.;Gary Vaynerchuk

Zeldman has been around the Web for a long time and his experience shows. This book teaches the concepts history and technologies behind web design for beginning and intermediate designers. Its unexpectedly funny I laughed out loud several times at Zeldmans puns and wordplay.  The book is about why and how to write structural semantic markup styled with CSS for sites that are relatively lightweight portable findable and accessible. It emphasizes the importance of following web standards set by the W3C.  The book covers the trinity of web standards structure presentation and behavior. Topics include HTML and XHTML CSS typography accessibility DOM scripting and JavaScript. This third edition of the book was published in 2010 so it also covers HTML5 and CSS3. Its more conceptual than instructional but there are plenty of examples and even a few reverseengineering exercises.  I enjoyed reading about the history of the various web technologies the evolution of browsers and the people and organizations who influenced them. I was already familiar with much of this history but I learned quite a bit that I didnt know about the Webs dusty past.  Ive been looking for the best web design books and this book was consistently ranked near the top of lists. Zeldman is wellknown in the industry for his advocacy of web standards and his involvement in A List Apart. A few months ago I started listening to The Big Web Show podcast a 5By5 show that Zeldman cohosts.  Notes  For SEO 1) write great content and 2) mark it up semantically.  Ems are the ideal unit for font sizes but pixels (px) are OK because browsers support Page Zoom.  Making a site accessible benefits not only the disabled but also mobile device users and search engines.;Jeffrey Zeldman Ethan Marcotte

It starts with the best and worst foods of different types such as breakfasts salads and sandwiches then moves on to the best and worst foods for health concerns such as blood pressure and cholesterol.  The book focuses mostly on restaurant foods and packaged supermarket foods but fresh and raw foods are also included. Of course the nutritional info can be generalized to foods regardless of where you buy and eat them.  Below are a few notes I made while reading. Im going to avoid duplicating notes from my reviews of the other Eat This Not That books so read those reviews or read the books yourself  Restaurant nutrition tips  Choose fish and meat thats baked or roasted not breaded or fried.  The average chicken wrap has 50 more calories than a grilled chicken sandwich.  On subs double the meat and halve the bread protein is better than carbs. Load the sub with veggies.  Sides are often healthier and cheaper than other menu items.  Avoid wraps and burritos theyre full of carbs sodium and fat.  Pitas are usually healthy.  Avoid bread bowls.  Nutrition tips  For breakfast protein is better than carbs. You burn more calories and have more energy. Make lean protein about 40 of the meals calories then add fiber (with whole grains) and healthy fats. Protein and fiber provide satiety making you feel full longer.  Red and yellow peppers have twice the Vitamin C as green peppers.  Avoid granola its covered in sugar and oil.  Limit the sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite in packaged meats.  Plain Greek yogurt is better than regular sweetened yogurt.  Pay more attention to sugar than fat. Sugar and simple refined carbs elevate blood sugar and trigger fat storage.  Best foods for preventing wrinkles sweet potatoes carrots papaya tuna salmon flaxseed.  Aim for a 11 ratio of potassium to sodium. Highpotassium foods bananas sweet potatoes spinach raisins tomatoes.  Avoid partially hydrogenated oils they lead to trans fat.  Avoid pie the crust usually contains trans fat.  Fish (best to worst) wild salmon farmed rainbow trout Pacific halibut farmed catfish farmed tilapia yellowfin tuna farmed salmon mahimahi  Avoid Krabsurimi its processed hake and pollock.  Deli cheese (best to worst) Mozzarella Swiss American Brie goat Pepper Jack cheddar.  Beer nutrition  Choose beer with low calories and low carbs.

But with a typical price tag of 5000 to 10000 for a usability consultant to conduct each round of tests it rarely happens.In this howto companion to Dont Make Me Think A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability Steve Krug spells out an approach to usability testing that anyone can easily apply to their own web site application or other product.

I liked Krugs humorous writing and entertaining use of quotations and the books cartoons make it even easier to understand. I didnt find it as informative as Krugs previous book Dont Make Me Think.  Krug says that DIY usability testing is inferior to hiring a usability consultant but its better than not testing. He says that if you can afford to you should hire a usability professional.  Krug summarizes his approach as follows  Basically the facilitator sits in a room with the participant gives him some tasks to do and asks him to think out loud while he does them. Theres no data gathering involved. Instead members of the development team stakeholders and any other interested parties observe the session from another room using screen sharing software. After the tests are finished the observers have a debriefing session where they compare notes and decide what problems should be fixed and how to fix them.  I read this because we do informal user testing at my web design company OptimWise and I want to improve our process.  Finding Usability Problems   Analytics can tell what people do but not why. Usability testing tells you why.   Krugs usability demo video   A typical test takes one hour.   The point is to identify major problems and fix them. Most kinds of problems that need to be fixed are so obvious that you dont need many testers.   Start testing as early as possible.   Before creating your own site test similar sites to learn from their positives and negatives.   A morning a month plan One round of testing monthly (on a regular schedule). Do three tests in the morning then debrief over lunch. Fix problems before the next round.   Try to get users who reflect your audience but you can learn from testing with practically anyone.   Dont use testers in more than one round of testing. After one round they know too much to be effective.   Create tasks (things you wanted to do) then expand them into scenarios (brief scripts with needed context and details).  Fixing Usability Problems   Focus on fixing the most serious problems first (determined by how many people will experience a problem and how severe it will be for those who experience it).   When fixing problems try to do the least you can do. Make it better for users right now. Dont bother with doing it right. Techniques tweak dont redesign take something distracting away.

They suggest keeping everything as simple as possible products services business administration etc. They advise against planning unnecessarily and recommend figuring things out as you go.  A recurring theme throughout the book is that you need to set aside time to work without interruptions. Workdays are fragmented by instant messages phone calls email and meetings destroying productivity. The only way to get things done is to get into the alone zone for about half of every day.  Another point is to be yourself be genuine and conversational. Youll attract better business partners employees and customers.

This book is a wellorganized thoughtprovoking read that I recommend to entrepreneurs business owners and employees.  Notes  Plan for the week not a year or longer thats just guessing.  Its OK to stay a small business large companies envy small businesses for their agility.  Solve your own problems rather than searching for others. Youll be more aware of the issues and more passionate about solving them.  Progress  A kickass half is better than a halfassed whole. Do fewer things and do them great.  Provide products and services that meet timeless desires not trends and fashions.  Productivity  Get into the alone zone to get things done without interruptions.  Never hold meetings unless theyre truly necessary.  Good enough is fine perfectionism prevents progress.  Get enough sleep so you maintain creativity.  Break estimates todo lists projects and decisions down into tiny pieces.  Evolution  Say no by default to features rushed deadlines demanding customers.  Let customers outgrow you theres an endless supply of small basic customers.  Promotion  Rather than advertising teach and share info to get peoples attention.  Emulate drug dealers give away a little for free to get customers hooked.  Start small and build slowly.  Hiring  Never hire anyone to do a job until youve tried it yourself and understand the work.  Hire when it hurts wait until youre suffering before hiring.  When people complain about changes give them time to adjust before backpedaling.  Encourage employees to have a life outside of work theyll work more efficiently to leave work on time.  Ideas are immortal but inspiration lasts a short time. When youre inspired seize the moment to be productive.;Jason Fried David Heinemeier Hansson
1118;6976036;4;50548;1591843030;Seth Godins three essential questions for every marketerWhats your storyWill the people who need to hear this story believe itIs it trueAll marketers tell stories. And if they do it right we believe them. We believe that wine tastes better in a 20 glass than a 1 glass. We believe that an 80000 Porsche is vastly superior to a 36000 Volkswagen thats virtually the same car. We believe that 125 sneakers make our feet feel betterand look coolerthan a 25 brand. And believing it makes it true.As Seth Godin showed in this controversial book great marketers dont talk about features or even benefits. Instead they tell a storya story we wantto believe whether its factual or not. In a world where most people have an infinite number of choices and no time to make them every organization is a marketer and all marketing is about telling stories.Marketers succeed when they tell us a story that fits our worldview a story that we intuitively embrace and then share with our friends. Think of the Dyson vacuum cleaner or Fiji water or the iPod.But beware If your stories are inauthentic you cross the line from fib to fraud. Marketers fail when they are selfish and scurrilous when they abuse the tools of their trade and make the world worse. Thats a lesson learned the hard way by telemarketers cigarette companies and sleazy politicians.But for the rest of us its time to embrace the power of the story. As Godin writes Stories make it easier to understand the world. Stories are the only way we know to spread an idea. Marketers didnt invent storytelling. They just perfected it.;0;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;All Marketers Are Liars The Underground Classic That Explains How Marketing Really Works  and Why Authenticity Is the Best Marketing of All;nonfiction;Godin shows how to use storytelling as marketing. He says that the successful marketers are those who honestly tell a story people want to believe and share. He describes principles and plenty of specific examples. Theres no filler.  Despite the title Godin isnt advocating lying. He calls the stories that consumers believes lies because they often arent completely factually accurate. Stories are the lies consumers tell themselves based on the emotional need they want to fill by acquiring a product or service.  Summary  Your story is your product. People want to know it. Make it consistent and authentic. Frame it in terms of the worldview of the person youre telling the story to (marketing to). Live it out loud. Support it with every action you take and your packaging ads customer service etc. Dont worry about those who dont want to hear it. Tell it to those who will listen believe and tell their friends.  Highlights  When people expect a certain outcome their brains filter their experience to match. People tell themselves stories and then work hard to make them true. For example at a ravedabout restaurant people remember the good and forget the bad.  The story is what people set out to buy. Lies satisfy our desires. Its the story not the good or the service that you actually sell that pleases the consumer. Nobody buys pure design ... They buy the way the process makes them feel.  Stories (not ideas not features not benefits) spread from persontoperson.  The best stories dont teach people anything new. Instead the best stories agree with what the audience already believes and makes the members of the audience feel smart and secure when reminded how right they were in the first place.  Their Worldview  Find a shared worldview and frame a story around that view.  Dont try to change someones worldview. Dont try to use the facts to prove your case.  Instead of targeting niches target the much bigger opportunity overlooked big markets comprised of people with complementary worldviews.  Its not enough to find a niche that shares a worldview. That niche has to be ready and able to influence a large group of their friends. They can turn a small market into a cult into a movement and then a trend and finally into a mass market. Seek out early adopters (those who want to try new stuff) persuade some that youve found the answer theyre seeking. You succeed by being an extremist in your storytelling then gracefully moving your product or service to the middle so it becomes more palatable to audiences that are persuaded by their friends not by you.  Marketing  Marketers succeed by creating an emotional want not by filling a simple need.  In marketing you have to hint at the facts not announce them. You cannot prove your way into a sale  you gain a customer when the customer proves to herself that youre a good choice.  Tell a different story than your competitors. Persuade those listening that your story is more important than the story they currently believe. Tell a story thats different in kind not in degree.  The only stories that spread are the remarkable ones the I cant believe that stories.;Seth Godin

Its an easytouse guide that draws from a variety of traditions suggesting how different cultures through the ages have arrived at the same enduring wisdom about food. Whether at the supermarket or an allyoucaneat buffet this is the perfect guide for anyone who ever wondered What should I eat;140;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Food Rules An Eaters Manual;nonfiction;A collection of 64 short memorable rules (or personal policies) for healthy eating given in everyday language. The rules fit within three incredibly simple yet oftignored overarching rules Eat food. Mostly plants. Not too much. These rules are designed to help you eat real food in moderation and substantially get off the Western diet.  Theres almost no scientific research or data presented in the book. Pollan admits this and says that humans havent needed nutrition science to survive the past several millennia and neither do we. However he does refer readers to his book In Defense of Food for the science behind his rules in this book.  I agreed with most of Pollans rules but I disagreed with a few in the Not too much chapter. Rule 46 Stop eating before youre full and Rule 53 Serve a proper portion and dont go back for seconds dont work for me. If I dont eat until Im full (or beyond) at least every few meals I get so hungry that I feel faint. I have a high metabolism (and have been at a healthy weight all my adult life).  I also have an issue with Rule 61 Leave something on your plate and the saying better to go to waste than to waist. If you need to throw food away to keep from overeating you have a discipline problem. Wasting food is also a slap in the face to the millions of starving people around the world. I have no problem with leaving something on your plate just save it to eat later dont throw it away.  I liked most of the rules and plan to follow my favorites  Notes  Eat food eat real whole foods with simple ingredients that have been minimally processed.  Rule 2 Dont eat anything your greatgrandmother wouldnt recognize as food. Avoid artificial foodlike substances.  Rule 3 Avoid food products containing ingredients that no ordinary human would keep in the pantry.  Rule 9 Avoid food products with the words lite lowfat or nonfat. The fat is normally replaced with salt and sugar. Youre better off eating the real thing in moderation.  Rule 13 Eat only foods that will eventually rot. Real food goes bad.  Rule 14 Eat foods made from ingredients that you can picture in their raw state or growing in nature.  Rule 19 If it came from a plant eat it if it was made in a plant dont.  Mostly plants  Rule 22 Eat mostly plants especially leaves.  Rule 24 The fewer the legs the better. Eat in decreasing amounts plants fungus and fish then poultry then mammals.  Rule 37 The whiter the bread the sooner youll be dead. Eat whole grains not white refined grains.  Rule 38 Favor the kinds of oils and grains that have traditionally been stoneground. Oils olive sesame palm fruit peanut.  Not too much  Rule 44 Pay more eat less. Choose quality over quantity. Better to pay the grocer than the doctor.  Rule 54 Breakfast like a king lunch like a prince dinner like a pauper. Decrease the size of your meals throughout the day.  Rule 55 Eat meals. Eat full meals and reduce snacking.  Rule 56 Limit snacks to unprocessed plant foods. Fruits veggies nuts.  Rule 63 Cook. Cook your own food to control your diet.;Michael Pollan

A chapter on each muscle group plus chapters with general info on exercise and nutrition. Tips for using equipment effectively. Ive been a fan of Mens Health materials for years.  Notes  Lifting Questions  Do as many sets as you need to complete at least 25 reps for a muscle group.  Lift 3 or 4 daysweek with rest (muscle repair) between each.  Do 1 exercise per muscle group per workout.  Lift fast lower slowly (23 seconds).  Chest  Do a similar number of reps for upper back as for chest to prevent imbalance.  Arms  Save exercises that target arms for end of workout because arms are involved in every upperbody exercise and you dont want to tire them early.  Core  When doing Barbell Rollout (or ab wheel) start with shoulder over barbell (or wheel).  Do ab exercises fast. Do as many reps as possible in 20 sec.  Nutrition  Cut back on starch. Limit to 2 servingsday (1 serving is 1 slice of bread 1 cup of cereal half potato half cup cooked pasta rice beans). Among produce limit potatoes beans corn peas (all starchy).  Choose a fullfat salad dressing made with olive or canola oil or balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Fatfree dressings are often loaded with sugar. Also fat helps the body absorb the salads vitamins.  Eat most of your days starch and sugar immediately before or after workout.  Protein eggs beef turkey pork chicken fish milk yogurt cheese (including cottage) nut butter nuts seeds protein powder.  You can eat 2 handfuls of almonds per day without gaining weight.  Best protein powder ingredients whey and casein. Whey is best for after workout casein for other times. Try a blend.  Protein concentrate is cheapest less pure but same benefits. Isolate more pure (lower fat and carbs).;Adam Campbell

Tony Hsieh CEO Zappos.comIn bestsellers such as Purple Cowand Tribes Seth Godin taught readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. But this book is about youyour choices your future and your potential to make a huge difference in whatever field you choose.There used to be two teams in every workplace management and labor. Now theres a third team the linchpins. These people figure out what to do when theres no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work pour their best selves into it and turn each day into a kind of art.Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations. They may not be famous but theyre indispensable. And in todays world they get the best jobs and the most freedom.As Godin writes Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. Its time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you your contribution is essential and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it and you must.;244;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Linchpin Are You Indispensable;nonfiction;Seth Godin dishes out thoughtprovoking advice on standing out and succeeding in an economy of commodity goods and services. His advice in a world of cold commercial systems you must make transactions personal and human. Emotional labor sets you apart. You cant compete simply on your ability to complete the task (the physical or intellectual labor). Interact and connect with people and give gifts by by going beyond what your job requires.  The best summary I found is when Godin says You must become indispensable to thrive in the new economy. The best ways to do that are to be remarkable insightful an artist someone bearing gifts. To lead. The worst way is to conform and become a cog in a giant system.  Godin references several of his other books including Tribes Purple Cow and The Dip. I really liked Purple Cow and Ill have to add his other books to my list.  I highly recommend this book to college graduates entrepreneurs and any ambitious businessperson.  Notes  Expertise gives you enough insight to reinvent what everyone else assumes to be the truth.  Art is the intentional act of using your humanity to create a change in another person. You can do it anywhere in any job.  Its not an effort contest its an art contest. People dont care how hard you try only what you deliver.  Real artists ship. Dont let perfectionism prevent you from finishing and delivering.  Avoid busywork. Do only work that leads to shipping.  The more generously you give your art away the more it will spread and the more people will pay for it.  You cant always do what you love but you can always love what you do.  7 abilities of a linchpin  1. Providing a unique interface between members of the organization  2. Delivering unique creativity  3. Managing a situation or organization of great complexity  4. Leading customers  5. Inspiring staff  6. Providing deep domain knowledge  7. Possessing a unique talent;Seth Godin

Katnisss family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it. District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone it seems has had a hand in the carefully laid plansexcept Katniss.The success of the rebellion hinges on Katnisss willingness to be a pawn to accept responsibility for countless lives and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels Mockingjayno matter what the personal cost.;392;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1358275419m7260188.jpg;Mockingjay (The Hunger Games 3);youngadult;I was disappointed by this finale to the Hunger Games trilogy. I didnt find it as interesting or compelling as The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Its significantly darker and more depressing than the first books and there are many gruesome deaths. Still I liked the end it resolves many loose ends and brings closure to the series.  Katniss finds herself playing the halfhearted figurehead of the rebellion against the Capitol. She seems like a different character in this book her entertaining humor is entirely absent. She nurses a seething vengeance and at some points shes apathetically emotionless. Her inability to choose between Gale and Peeta is drawn out to the point of annoyance but is finally resolved at the end and I liked the epilogue.  One thing I really enjoyed about the first two books was seeing everything in realtime firstperson from Katniss perspective. In this book there are many times where Katniss isnt present for the events so another character summarizes what happened. In the first two books the settings and actions were so vividly described that I could picture them effortlessly. In this book it was much more difficult it felt more like reading the story than being in it.  This book didnt live up to its potential but its worth reading to complete the story and discover the fates of the series many characters.;Suzanne Collins

Much of the book is focused on dealing with upset customers. It covers many scenarios and gives specific scripts for what to say.  I read this because Im currently working on making customer service at my web agency OptimWise even better.  Notes  Fundamental Principles  Companies that ask employees to make customers happier have happier employees with lower turnover and absenteeism and higher morale and satisfaction.  Use I instead of they or we. This shows customer that you will take care of them.  RATER how customers evaluate service quality  R reliability. Provide what was promised dependably and accurately.  A assurance. Knowledge and courtesy you show ability to convey trust competence confidence.  T tangibles physical facilities and equipment appearance of staff.  E empathy. Caring and individual attention.  R responsiveness. Willingness to help promptly.  Reliability means keeping service promise (organizational commitments common expectations personal promises).  Wrong attitude you need time to understand customers problem before you can make commitment. Right attitude customer needs reassurance of your commitment before theyll give you time to understand problem.  For timid customers with limited knowledge or experience make them comfortable by educating and supporting.  For knowledgeable experienced demanding customers acknowledge their experience and skip handholding. I see you brought your requirements. You always make my job so much easier. Let me take a quick look and see if I have any questions.  Building empathy statements  1. Lead in I hear that I see that or Its clear to me that ...  2. Acknowledge person You  3. Describe feeling angry frustrated anxious disappointed nervous confused surprised  4. Describe situation  Examples I hear the frustration that you think no one can solve your problem. I see you are surprised by the change in our return policy since you last shopped with us.  Make intangible service tangible. Example hotel customer asks for directions to restaurant. Pointing the way is intangible. Drawing a map is tangible. Having a preprinted map with specific directions is tangible and knockyoursocksoff.  Research shows that customers cause about 13 of problems they complain about. Acting like customer is always right can prevent education and problemsolving harming them and you.  Dont try to educate the irate. That will make them more upset. Avoid embarrassing customers whove made a mistake.  3 strikes policy 1st and 2nd time customer and you disagree act like its your mistake. 3rd time impose penalty.  How Tos  Customers feel theyve been treated fairly when  They feel listened to and respected even if they dont get the outcome theyre seeking  The process is painless  You keep performance promises  You treat them ethically  You acknowledge their unique wishes  Their best interests are placed ahead of companys convenience  Seamless Service  Nothing says knock your socks off service like a willingness to go out of your way and do just a little extra to help them meet their needs.  Its not the tigers and bears that chase the customers away. What bugs the customer the most are the mosquitoes and the gnatsthe little things.  ProblemSolving  If the customer thinks its a problem it is. Its any time theyre upset dismayed angered or disappointed. You cant wish a problem away because its unreasonable or not your fault.  Recovery process  1. Apologize regardless of fault. Acknowledge problem and show concern for disappointment.  2. Listen and empathize. Show that you care about them and problem.  3. Fix problem quickly and fairly. A fair fix is one delivered with a sense of professional concern. Customers want what they expected in first place.  4. Offer atonement. They want a valueadded gesture that says I want to make it up to you. Atonement isnt always necessary its critical when customer feels injured victimized greatly inconvenienced.  5. Keep promises. Take immediate steps to fix.  6. Follow up to ensure problem is fixed to customers satisfaction.  Apologizing isnt accepting blame or liability its simply an acknowledgement that things arent right in customers eyes.  If apologizing feels like taking too much blame say Thank you for bringing that to my attention.  Service recovery expectations  Receive explanation of how problem happened  Be allowed to talk to someone in authority  Be told how long it will take to fix problem  Be given useful alternatives if problem cant be fixed  Be told how to prevent future problem  Fix the person then the problem. Give customer an opportunity to vent apologize reassure then fix problem.  Treat customer like a partner in problemsolving. Ask the customer What do you think we should do to resolve the problem This restores feeling of control calms them and restores sense of justice.  Say Im sorry this has occurred and Ill make sure it gets cleared up right away. Dont blame a third party or a misunderstanding.  Top 10 recovery actions  1. CSR dealt with upset  2. CSR apologized  3. CSR didnt become defensive but showed humility and poise  4. CSR followed up  5. CSR showed skill at problemsolving  6. CSR admitted organizational error when appropriate didnt shift blame  7. CSR acted in fully responsible empowered fashion  8. CSR showed good interpersonal skills particularly listening  9. CSR showed empathy for customers plight and upset  10. CSR believed customer and valued their perception  Feel felt found approach I can understand that you feel _. Other people including myself have felt the same way. Weve found that _ solves the problem.  When the best solution is obvious present several options then ask the customers preference.  If customer rejects solution you suggest you may not be solving the real problem. Keep probing by asking what theyd like to see happen.  If customer directs anger at you personally say Have I done something personally to upset you Id like to help. Please give me a chance.  For egotistical customer dont talk policy. Say For you I can offer [whatever standard policy is].;Performance Research Associates Lloyd James Sean Pratt Performance Research Associates Inc

1125;7673227;4;50548;;From primordial nothingness to this very moment A Short History of Nearly Everythingreports what happened and how humans figured it out. To accomplish this daunting literary task Bill Bryson uses hundreds of sources from popular science books to interviews with luminaries in various fields. His aim is to help people like him who rejected stale school textbooks and dry explanations to appreciate how we have used science to understand the smallest particles and the unimaginably vast expanses of space. With his distinctive prose style and wit Bryson succeeds admirably.Though A Short Historyclocks in at a daunting 500plus pages and covers the same material as every science book before it it reads something like a particularly detailed novel (albeit without a plot). Each longish chapter is devoted to a topic like the age of our planet or how cells work and these chapters are grouped into larger sections such as The Size of the Earth and Life Itself. Bryson chats with experts like Richard Fortey (author of Lifeand Trilobite) and these interviews are charming. But its when Bryson dives into some of sciences best and most embarrassing fightsCope vs. Marsh Conway Morris vs. Gouldthat he finds literary gold.

I found the stories of eccentric scientists entertaining. I didnt learn much science I was already aware of most from school (6th grade through college) and my own reading. Unsurprisingly as a Christian creationist I didnt agree on all points about the origins of the cosmos or life.  Bryson covers a range of disciplines chemistry biology genetics physics quantum mechanics astronomy cosmology geology paleontology oceanography and many more. A major theme in the book is how limited is our knowledge about the universe Earth and life even today.;Bill Bryson Richard Matthews

This book shows you how to have the freelance lifestyle you want and still achieve financial success. Topics include marketing prospecting client relations pricing productivity worklife balance and income streams.  The 3 authors dispense page after page of practical advice for web designers graphic designers copywriters and other freelancers. I liked the many efficiency and productivity tips and especially liked the chapters on pricing focus worklife balance and the appendix on opportunities and obstacles.  The authors use wealthy to mean more than financial success they say A wealthy freelancer is someone who consistently gets the projects clients income and lifestyle he or she wants and Wealthy freelancers dont just make a living. They design a fulfilling and meaningful life.  I read this book because it was recommended by FreelanceSwitch.  Secret 3 Create Your Amazing Buzz Piece  Create a buzz piece like a special report howto guide tips interview QA.   Send to contacts including current clients and past prospects who didnt buy.   Put it on your website.   Include it in pitch letters quotes proposals.   Include a bio page with an intro services and call to action.  Secret 4 Employ HighImpact Prospecting Tactics  Find organizations whose members truly understand the value of your services and could potentially hire you. Become an active member in 13 organizations. Volunteer and join committees and boards.  Secret 5 Cultivate Repeat and Referral Business   The more successful you appear the less likely that clients will give referrals since they assume you dont need them. Be sure they know you want referrals.   Ask each client for referrals when you deliver the project and theyre happy.   Only 515 of prospects are ready to buy. About half of the remainder will buy in 1824 months.   Share relevant items of interest in a nonpromotional way.  Secret 7 Price Your Services For Success  Hourly rate vs. fixed project price  Use project pricing for the following reasons   Clients prefer it because it eliminates price uncertainty. Hourly rates worry them.   You have to provide a project price anyway because you have to estimate your hours for the project.   It lifts your income ceiling because as you get better and faster income increases. Youre rewarded for getting good. Hourly rates do the opposite.   Your income isnt limited by the hours you work as with hourly rates.   You dont need to provide clients with timesheets.   It takes rate comparisons out of the question so the client considers whether the project is worth the price rather than if you are worth your rate.  If the project is undefined hourly may be the better choice.  Create a fee schedule with price ranges.   Instills confidence in the client.   Simplifies quoting.   Deters lowpaying clients.  Provide a ballpark price during initial calls to deal with price objections right away. Later provide quoteproposal based on details.  Ask clients what they want to accomplish. They pay for results not work.  Response to price objections I can appreciate your concern. Although that fee range is typical of what professionals charge for this type of project Im sure we can work something out. How much were you expecting to budget for this work  Dont simply lower your price negotiate an exchange of value   Offer to get the job done faster.   Throw in an extra.   Offer a discount for paying the full fee in advance.   Ask for more time for the project.   Offer a volume discount for additional work.  After sending a quote follow up the same or next day. Act like you got the job and ask about getting started. Dont mention price.  Secret 8 Bring Focus to Your Freelance Business   Discover what you have to offer by considering your education work history hobbies interests passions.   Focus on a niche market such as industry project type client type etc.  Unique Selling Proposition (USP)  1. What do you do Type of freelance work.  2. For whom Identify the market.  3. What makes you different What you have to offer.  Secret 10 Construct Your Own WorkLife Reality   Outsource chores. Pay someone else to do the things you hate and spend time making money or doing something you enjoy.   Train clients to respect your time by not communicating outside business hours.  Secret 11 Create Alternative Streams of Income   Convert freebies into attractive service packages and charge a professional fee.   Focus on what you do best and enjoy. Outsource the rest of the project.   Sell information products like ebooks and podcasts.   Join affiliate programs for products and services you frequently recommend.   Sell seminars and teaching gigs.  Secret 12 Live and Work in the Wealthy Triangle  Most freelancers dont need professional liability (errors and omissions) insurance but consult an attorney.  Opportunities and Obstacles  Dont consider contingency fee (percentage of profits) arrangements unless the client has a good reputation and track record. If you do base fees on something trackable like clicks or sales not profits. Demand a 50 deposit. Have a detailed contract.  Spell out the number and timeframe of allowed revisions in quoteproposalagreement. Tell clients you want final revisions not multiple drafts.  Dont be afraid to take on new project types. They could be great learning experiences wellpaying and first steps toward becoming an expert. If the client is ready for you to start do your research and go If you need to sell the client admit that you havent done that type of work specifically but tell them about similar work youve done.  Never reduce fees for the promise of future work. Its better to spend time finding betterpaying clients than doing underpaid work.;Steve Slaunwhite Pete Savage Ed Gandia

Overall my thoughts on this book are the same as The New Answers Book so see that review. Only a few of the 38 questions deals directly with evolution (biological geological or cosmological). The others focus on the Flood biblical interpretation and application theological questions biblical historicity and inerrancy and culturalmoral implications.  The chapters are brief and written for laymen but they include many references to longer papers and books for those interested.  You can read a few chapters online. Below are my notes.  Was the Flood of Noah Global or Local in Extent  Was the Flood of Noah Global or Local in Extent gives biblical theological and logical reasons why the flood couldnt have been local.  Did Bible Authors Believe in a Literal Genesis  Old and New Testament authors and Jesus took Genesis 111 as historical fact.  OT 1 Chr 18 Ps 3369 Ps 1045 Ps 19 Ps 136 Is 549 Ez 141420.  NT Mt 1117 Lk 32338 Rom 51219 1 Cor 152122  4547 2 Cor 113 1 Tim 21314 1 Cor 1189 Rom 120 1 Pet 320 2 Pet 249 2 Pet 337.  Jesus Mt 1936 Mk 1039 Lk 115051 Mt 243839 Mk 131920 Lk 115051.  What about the Similarity Between Human and Chimp DNA  Emphasis on percent DNA similarity misses the point because it ignores both the magnitude of the actual differences as well as the significance of the role that single amino acid changes can play.  Similar junk DNA may actually be functional or may be genetic hotspots that are prone to the same mutation.  What Are Some of the Best Flood Evidences  See also Worldwide Flood Evidence.  What about Bacteria  Only about 8 percent of the identified bacteria cause disease. Postulates that bacteria may have become pathogenic after the Fall similar to the way plants developed thorns and thistles as a result of the Fall. See also Bacteria More Good than Bad and Ugly.  Why Did God Make Viruses  ...Some portions of DNA in animals that look like thy came from a virus...horizontal gene flow (genes picked up from somewhere in the environment rather than inherited from parents) may help to explain rapid adaptation and the interesting pattern of DNA in animals.  Since viruses carry genetic material (DNA or RNA) they are the most logical agents to suspect in transferring genes. While horizontal gene transfer would not change the identity of an animal (i.e. it would still belong to the same kind) it could rapidly provide a source of genetic variability that allows for rapid adaptation. If this is the case then viruses were created good (as in Genesis 1) with a support role much like bacteria are known to have.  See also Why Did God Make Viruses.  Isnt the God of the Old Testament Harsh Brutal and Downright Evil  Throughout the Old Testament cases where people groups were killed in Gods judgment had these elements in common the people were sinning God provided justice and God provided salvation.  In light of this God should not be blamed but those who were punished for their sin retain the blame God did provide a means of salvation in each of these cases even though He was not obligated to do so.  Consider the analogy of a person who steals and gets caught. When he stands before the judge the judge finds him guilty and imposes a fine. But then the judge offers to pay the fine. Instead of accepting the thief refuses and blames the whole mess on the judge who acted justly and even offered a way out  Doesnt the Bible Support Slavery  See The Bible and Slavery especially the end (A few pointers to remember).;Ken Ham
1128;8010207;4;50548;1600510205;This booklet (45 pages) is an ideal and significant introduction to classical education. It traces the history of classical education and describes its modern renaissance. The book also highlights the distinctive elements of the movement including its emphasis on teaching grammar logic and rhetoric (the Trivium) and the extraordinary achievements of students who are receiving a classical education. It explains the benefit of classical language study (Latin and Greek) and integrated learning through a study of the great books of western civilization. The booklet is written in a colloquial and informative style with anecdotes diagrams and charts. This book is recommended to parents just beginning their examination of classical education.;45;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1374623940m8010207.jpg;An Introduction To Classical Education A Guide For Parents;nonfiction;Concise and very informative intro to classical education. Explains origins and academic model and answers common questions.Classical education is the authoritative traditional and enduring form of education begun by the Greeks and Romans developed through history and now being renewed and recovered in the 21st century.Notes  Classical education reigned for 1000 years before being eclipsed 100 years ago though parts have remained in schools and colleges.  Basic philosophy teach children in ways they naturally want to be taught despite not always knowing it. Teach what children want to know when they want to know it.  In Middle Ages (c 500  1560 AD) curriculum of trivium (grammar logic rhetoric) and quadrivium (astronomy arithmetic music geography) were established.  Modern progressive model of education was introduced in US in early 1800s and slowly grew to dominance by 1950.  Modern progressive education emphasized need to train citizens for industrialized America and later emphasized entertainment and fun over work achievement discipline. In last 20 years emphasis has been on philosophical and moral relativism and skepticism and egalitarianism.  Trivium subjects arent really subjects theyre a method for learning subjects.  Classical educators favor tool over content helping students master more content. They teach how to learn.  Classical education teaches Latin because its mother tongue of over 50 of English words and up to 90 of Romance languages and helps children learn languages.  Method for tackling new subject 1) break it down to fundamentals 2) study relationships of fundamentals 3) write and speak clearly on whats been learned applying and integrating knowledge in new settings.  Students in classical schools typically score in top 1015 on national tests like SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) and Stanford Achievement Test and (also called SAT).  Classical schools often dont offer as much in athletic programs and extracurriculars partly because theyre young schools with little time and money and partly because academics are prioritized.;Christopher Perrin

But where do they come from What kind of environment breeds them What sparks the flash of brilliance How do we generate the breakthrough technologies that push forward our lives our society our culture Steven Johnsons answers are revelatory as he identifies the seven key patterns behind genuine innovation and traces them across time and disciplines. From Darwin and Freud to the halls of Google and Apple Johnson investigates the innovation hubs throughout modern time and pulls out the approaches and commonalities that seem to appear at moments of originality.;326;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1311705993m8034188.jpg;Where Good Ideas Come From The Natural History of Innovation;nonfiction;This book shows that good ideas (or key innovations) are generally products of prior discoveries experimentation and collaboration not the Eureka moments of isolated geniuses. I found the historical anecdotes interesting and the lessons somewhat insightful but overall the book wasnt especially fascinating. I also felt that Johnsons repeated comparisons of human ingenuity to evolutionary ecology were stretching the metaphor and didnt contribute to his points. My favorite chapter was The Fourth Quadrant which explores innovation in marketbased (profitseeking) and nonmarketbased environments.  The books last paragraph gives advice on having good ideas which is a concise summary of the book Go for a walk cultivate hunches write everything down but keep your folders messy embrace serendipity make generative mistakes take on multiple hobbies frequent coffeehouses and other liquid networks follow the links let others build on your ideas borrow recycle reinvent.  The appendix contains an interesting chronology of key innovations from 14002000 AD which shows that many innovations were discovered independently by separate innovators and that many were based on years of research built on previous ideas.  I read this because it was listed in .net Magazines The top 50 books for web designers and developers. The list has since been updated and no longer includes it.  The Adjacent Possible   Good ideas are constrained by the parts (physical or conceptual materials) and skills that surround them.   Ideas are limited by the adjacent possible the realm of options made reachable by previous ideas.   The best environments for creating good ideas are those that help people expose the adjacent possible by exposing a diverse sample of mechanical or conceptual parts and encouraging novel ways of recombining them.   Bad environments punish experimentation obscure branches of possibility and make the current state so satisfying that no one explores.   To have good ideas dont sit in isolation and think big thoughts get more parts on the table.  Liquid Networks  Its not the wisdom of the crowd but the wisdom of someone in the crowd. Individuals get smarter because theyre connected to a social network.  The Slow Hunch  Hunches need space and time to evolve.  Serendipity  How to trigger serendipitous thoughts go for a walk take a shower or bath read get away from work and tasks.  Errors  Errors force us to rethink our biases and contemplate alternatives spurring innovation.  Exaptation  Great innovators have many hobbies and ideas from different projects make connections that lead to insights.  The Fourth Quadrant   Marketbased competition has no monopoly on innovation. Competition and the profit motive do indeed motivate us to turn good ideas into shipping products but more often than not the ideas themselves come from somewhere else.   From the 1800s on innovation has increasingly taken place in collaborative groups (collective invention) inside and outside the market.   Why do some good ideas flourish without economic incentives Nonmarket environments are more efficient because theyre more open than market environments which have barriers like copyright patents and trade secrets. People can focus on creating new ideas rather than spend time and money protecting old ones.;Steven Johnson

Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems the rational mind and the emotional mind that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort but if it is overcome change can come quickly.In Switch the Heaths show how everyday people  employees and managers parents and nurses  have united both minds and as a result achieved dramatic resultsThe lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched decadesold medical practice that was endangering patients.The homeorganizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping.The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customersupport team into service zealots by removing a standard tool of customer serviceIn a compelling storydriven narrative the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology sociology and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. Switch shows that successful changes follow a pattern a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.(c)2010 Chip Heath (P)2010 Random House;294;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Switch How to Change Things When Change Is Hard (Audiobook);nonfiction;A moderately engaging guide to making lasting changes in companies communities and our own lives. There are plenty of specific examples of successful and unsuccessful switches.  The book uses the analogy of an elephant and its rider on a path. The elephant represents our emotional side the rider represents our rational side and the path represents the way to your desired change. The books sections follow this analogy Direct the Rider Motivate the Elephant and Shape the Path.  I didnt find this book as interesting as the authors previous book Made to Stick.  I had heard about this book from several sources and finally decided to read it when Daniel Pink recommended it in To Sell is Human. The audiobook narrated by Charles Kahlenberg is of excellent quality.  Direct the Rider   Be specific some is not a number soon is not a time.   Show the rider the destination and show the elephant why its worthwhile. A black and white (all or nothing) goal can prevent you from finding a loophole.  Motivate the Elephant   Successful change requires different sequence than we usually try not analyze think change but see feel change.   People are more likely to complete change and complete it faster if they think theyre already part of the way there. Example car washes that give you a card that already has 1 or 2 stamps.   Shrink the change when facing a daunting task break it into small chunks that you can easily complete. Scoring a victory will motivate you. Use small wins to motivate.   Sell an identity people will want to live up to it. Example parents act according to what they perceive that parents should do.  Shape the Path   Dont make the Fundamental Attribution Error thinking of problems as deeprooted parts of a persons personality or nature. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. Its easier to change the situation than the people.   Environmental tweaks (changes to the environment or situation) are more effective than selfcontrol.   Routine and habits are extremely effective.   Checklists are very effective at providing direction.   Rally the herd. Behavior is contagious. Show people that they arent conforming to the crowd to persuade them to conform.;Chip Heath Dan Heath

The story is written in firstperson present tense and maintains a good pace. That pace quickens near the actionpacked end and leads to a cliffhanger ending that implores you to read the sequel.  Its surprisingly violent and the author isnt afraid to wound or kill characters. The story features themes such as courage facing fears free will and independent thought manipulation and control the need for community and loyalty to family and friends.

There are a few good points but overall I found it severely dull. Its much longer than it needs to be being filled with examples ad nauseam. There are many better leadership books.  My favorite point was that peoples best thinking must be given not taken. Much of the book is about creating an environment in which people willingly give their best thinking.  I liked the distinction made between stress and pressure in Chapter 3 The Liberator. One feels stress when held to outcomes beyond their control. One feels pressure when reasonably expected to perform their best. Stress is negative pressure is positive. I also liked Chapter 6 The Investor which tells how to give people ownership rather than micromanaging which is my tendency.  According to the authors multipliers believe that people are smart and will figure things out. Personally I feel that this depends on the people and situation. In any given case the particular people may not be smart enough or the situation may not have a feasible solution. However I understand that the authors were simply contrasting this view with that of the Diminisher that people cant figure things out without them.  I read this book for the Business Book Club at Herrick District Library.  Five Disciplines of the Multipler  1. Attract and optimize talent. The Diminisher is an Empire Builder. The Multiplier is a Talent Magnet.  2. Create intensity that requires best thinking. The Diminisher is a Tyrant. The Multiplier is a Liberator.  3. Extend Challenges. The Diminisher is a KnowItAll. The Multiplier is a Challenger.  4. Debate decisions. The Diminisher is a Decision Maker. The Multiplier is a Debate Maker.  5. Instill ownership and accountability. The Diminisher is a Micromanager. The Multiplier is an Investor.  The Multiplier Effect   Multipliers get an average 1.97 times more capability out of people than Diminishers do. They access 100 of peoples current abilities plus stretch them to expand their abilities.   Children praised for hard work do better than those praised for intelligence.   Logic of Multiplication Most people in organizations are underutilized. All capability can be leveraged with the right leadership. Therefore intelligence and capability can be multiplied without increasing investment.  The Talent Magnet   Genius comes in many forms. Appreciate all types.   Find peoples native genius something they do exceptionally well and absolutely naturally easily and freely.  The Liberator   Talk less listen more. Listen most of the time. Let others share what they know.  Stress vs. pressure   Requiring peoples best work is different from insisting on desired outcomes. Stress is created when people are expected to produce outcomes that are beyond their control. But they feel positive pressure when they are held to their best work.   Analogy William Tell shooting the apple off his sons head. William Tell feels pressure. His son feels stress.   Tyrants and Liberators both expect mistakes. Tyrants pounce on those who make them. Liberators learn as much as possible from the mistake.   Peoples best thinking must be given not taken. Diminishers believe that pressure increases performance. They demand peoples best thinking but dont get it.   The most powerful work is done in response to an opportunity not in response to a problem.  Peter Block.   Provide a starting point not a complete solution. Allow others to explore opportunities.   Ask the hard questions but dont answer them. Let others fill in the blanks.  The Investor   Multipliers believe that people are smart and will figure things out. Diminishers believe that people cant figure things out without them.   Allow people to learn from the consequences of their actions. Protecting them stunts their learning. Real intelligence develops from trial and error.;Liz Wiseman Greg McKeown

I picked up this book after hearing Richard Ferri interviewed on The Index Investing Show.  Lessons   Allocate across multiple asset classes to reduce risk.   Invest broadly within each class to eliminate the specific risk of any single security.   Keep costs as low as feasible including taxes.   Rebalance periodically (annually).

The longterm risk and return on US real estate has been on par with US stocks since 1930.   Use home ownership and commercial real estate investments as longterm investments.   Hold a max of 10 in REITs.  Miscellaneous asset allocation notes   The more asset classes the better up to about 12. This reduces risk and increases returns.   Include assets with no or low correlation.   Globally small and value stocks have higher returns due to higher risk. Add a small cap value fund to a total US market fund.   Foreign bonds arent worth owning due to high fees.   Skip commodities. They have no real returns they dont earn more than inflation in the long term.   Skip hedge funds.

Vaynerchuck shows that businesses need to build longterm personal relationships with their customers by caring about them. Social media because it magnifies word of mouth is more effective at making emotional connections than broadcast marketing.  Vaynerchuck uses stats case studies and firsthand experience to make his points and recommend actions. Although he mentions several specific platforms the ideas transcend the tools. I was inspired by Vaynerchucks Crush It  Why Now Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion and I plan to use the concepts in this book to make OptimWise succeed in the Thank You Economy.  How all businesses should use social media   Care. Respond to comments and invite people to share their thoughts. Outcare competitors that are bigger cheaper or more popular.   Show up first to connect with early adopters (firstmover advantage).   Be authentic. Be yourself and speak from the heart.   Connect with the individual not the business. Behind every B2B is a C.   Build a community to turn buyers in to advocates. Join or create conversations around topics related to your product or service. Thank people when they provide feedback positive or negative.   Focus on quality not quantity of fansfollowers.  Consumers in the Thank You Economy   People do business with people they like.   70 of people turn to family and friends for purchasing advice.   Make every customer feel special.   Dissatisfied customers are opportunities to fix problems and build relationships.  Social Media in the Thank You Economy   Social media takes time its a marathon.   Provide quality content followed by quality engagement.   Evoke emotion (positive or negative) so people are compelled to share.   Let consumers decide that they want to know you dont try to persuade them.   Pull people in dont push your message out.   Start and join conversations about your general interests first to build relationships. Later talk specifically about your business.;Gary Vaynerchuk

After exploring the basic concepts and syntax of PHP it shows how to work with files and databases. Its not as straightforward as Head First PHP MySQL (my review) but it definitely covers a lot more ground. Each chapter ends with several tips (usually best practices) and suggestions for digging deeper.  Variables   Use print for scalar (singlevalued) variables and print_r() for complex variables (arrays and objects).   Items in single quotes are treated literally items in double quotes are extrapolated (processed).  HTML Forms and PHP   In forms pass preset values using input typehidden.   Use GET to request info from the server use POST to trigger a serverside action. GET sends info via URL POST sends it invisibly.  Using Numbers   number_format() rounds and formats.  Using Strings   nl2br() converts newlines to break tags.   htmlentities() htmlspecialchars() and strip_tags() make userprovided data safe to print to the browser.   urlencode() encodes a string so it can be passed in a URL.   trim() removes whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.  Control Structures   empty() returns TRUE if a variable has no value value of 0 or value of FALSE. isset() returns TRUE if a variable has any value including 0 FALSE or the empty string.   break exits the current structure.   continue terminates the current iteration of the loop and checks the loop condition again.   exit and die terminate execution.   for loop performs specific statements for a determined number of iterations.   while loop continues as long as the condition is TRUE most often used to retrieve from a database.   do...while loop is same as while loop but guarantees that statements are executed at least once.  Using Arrays   foreach loop is used to iterate through an array.   Wrap array constructs in curly brackets to avoid problems with quotation marks.   There are several sorting functions to get by values or keys. Pay attention to maintaining keyvalue association if necessary.   implode() turns an array into a string. join() is synonymous.   explode() turns a string into an array.  Creating Web Applications   Include files with include() which warns but continues in case of errors or require() which terminates execution in case of errors. Generally avoid include_once() and require_once() which adversely affect performance.   Constants have unchanging values. Names are uppercase with no initial . Assign values with define().   To test whether a form has been submitted use if (_SERVER[REQUEST_METHOD]  POST) .   header() controls HTTP headers and can be used to redirect to another page.  Cookies and Sessions   setcookie() sends a cookie.   Delete a cookie by sending a cookie with the cookies name and a value of FALSE.   Use cookies when security isnt a concern and for  4 KB of data. Use sessions for more security and more data.   sesion_start() starts a session.   Delete a session with _SESSION  array() then session_destroy(). To delete an individual session value use unset().  Creating Functions   In functions arguments with default values must come after arguments without default values.   global makes a variable global usable outside the function.   Put an  in front of a function to suppress errors notices and warnings.   file_put_contents() opens and writes a file.   file() returns file contents as an array.  Files and Directories   Put writable files and directories outside of the Web root directory for security.   move_uploaded_file() moves an uploaded file from the temp directory.   md5() creates a hash.   fgets() and fgetscsv() read files incrementally.  Intro to Databases   mysqli_query() sends a SQL command to MySQL.   mysqli_connect() opens a connection to MySQL mysqli_close() closes it.   mysqli_select_db selects the database.   Dont use die() when a database error occurs its too heavyhanded.   mysqli_real_escape_string() escapes potentially harmful characters.   mysqli_fetch_array() fetches 1 row at a time.   Use TRUNCATE rather than DELETE FROM to empty a table.   mysqli_affected_rows() returns the number of records altered.   Add LIMIT 1 to UPDATE queries to affect only 1 row.

You have a multitasking distracted readytoleaveyoursiteatanytime audience who has very specific goals in mind. If your content doesnt meet those goals and quickly they will leave.  I liked Kissanes advice to Act as user advocates...reduce distractions in sidebars fight ads that obstruct content and give readers the equivalent of good light and a quiet room. She also makes a good point that content strategists must turn soft aspirational goals into specific measurable success criteria.  Good Content  Good Content is Useful  Define a clear specific purpose for each piece of content evaluate content against this purpose.  Good Content is Concise   Omit needless content.   Why is too much content bad It makes everything more difficult to find and results in lower quality content.   Common needless content mission statements press releases long feature lists rambling video and audio.  Good Content is Supported   Publish no content without a support plan.

Use analogies and metaphors.   A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add but when there is nothing left to take away.  Antoine de SaintExupery  Unexpected   Break a pattern.   Present a mystery to pique curiosity.  Concrete  To solve problems you need a common language. It needs to be concrete not abstract.  Credentialed   Concrete details add credibility.   Use endorsements from authorities and nonauthorities (average people).   Stats add credibility. Use them to show relationships not for absolute numbers.   Use the Sinatra test if you can make it here you can make it anywhere. Give one notable concrete example to prove your credibility.   Use testable credentials ask the audience see for yourself.  Emotional  If I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one I will. Mother Theresa  How can we make people care about our ideas   Get them to take off their analytical hats.   Create empathy for specific individuals.   Show how our ideas are associated with things people already care about.   Appeal to selfinterest. Example John Caples headline They laughed when I sat down at the piano...   Appeal to identity (example Dont Mess with Texas).    Group interest is often a better predictor of political opinion than selfinterest.    People dont ask whats in it for me but whats in it for my group    Appeal to who people already are and also who they would like to be.   Stay out of Maslows basement. People arent necessarily motivated by the lowest levels of Maslows hierarchy of needs. It isnt actually a hierarchy people pursue the various levels simultaneously theres overlap.  Stories   Stories provide simulation they cause the listener to mentally play along.   Mental practice is more effective for mental activity than physical activity. Metal practice yields two thirds the benefit of physical practice.   Stories provide inspiration which drive action.  Inspirational story plots   Challenge underdog story such as David and Goliath.   Connection overcoming barriers such as in The Good Samaritan and Romeo and Juliet.   Creativity mental breakthrough such as the apple falling on Newtons head.

The majority of the book evaluates specific restaurant meals telling you what to order and what to avoid. There are also chapters dealing with the supermarket special occasions and meals for kids. Even though I dont eat at most of the restaurants or shop for many of the foods the books value is in the nutritional rationale behind the selections.  The book promotes the ideal of eating foods closest to their natural forms. The fewer ingredients the better. The book is realistic however and points out the better choices among multiple options.

1146;10115852;1;50548;006204964X;Millions of Christians have struggled with how to reconcile Gods love and Gods judgment Has God created billions of people over thousands of years only to select a few to go to heaven and everyone else to suffer forever in hell Is this acceptable to God How is this good newsTroubling questionsso troubling that many have lost their faith because of them. Others only whisper the questions to themselves fearing or being taught that they might lose their faith and their church if they ask them out loud.But what if these questions trouble us for good reason What if the story of heaven and hell we have been taught is not in fact what the Bible teaches What if what Jesus meant by heaven hell and salvation are very different from how we have come to understand themWhat if it is God who wants us to face these questionsAuthor pastor and innovative teacher Rob Bell presents a deeply biblical vision for rediscovering a richer grander truer and more spiritually satisfying way of understanding heaven hell God Jesus salvation and repentance. The result is the discovery that the good news is much much better than we ever imagined.Love wins.;202;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1327878550m10115852.jpg;Love Wins A Book About Heaven Hell and the Fate of Every Person Who Ever Lived;nonfiction;Bell presents a universally appealing version of Christianity stripped of its offensive qualities. He interprets the Bible to say what we as humans want to hear love tolerance and fairness (as we see them). He makes a few good points about how Christians shouldnt focus so heavily on the afterlife that we ignore the lives we lead and the people we affect. Overall I found Bells Christianity to be a politically correct fantasy not a religion grounded in the Bible and Jesus true message. The book is short his explanations are shallow and the verses he uses to defend his views are rarely presented in context. Ill leave others to write lengthy refutations of Bells theology and Ill just hit a few points here.  I admit that by nature I wish the Bible and Christianity really were as inoffensive as Bell teaches. Im generally nonconfrontational so a faith thats all smiles is tempting. But the truth is that God isnt worried about offending humans and the Bible contains His message of both salvation and judgment. Yes it may leave a bitter taste in our mouths but thats because its beyond our sinful mortal ability to understand. God exists on a plane of consciousness so much higher than our own that we cant possibly apply our rules of happiness and fairness to His perfect plan and expect them to function properly.  I wasnt clear on Bells interpretation of Heaven. At one point he summarizes it as now somewhere else here sometime else and here and now. Heres what I gather the now somewhere else is a place souls go when they die but its very similar to our current lives and habits. The here sometime else is simply a continuation of the current creation redeemed and perfected by Christians achieved through political and social means and the eradication of suffering. This doesnt seem to fit with the destruction of the universe and its recreation in Revelation 21. The here and now is the state of living in harmony with God.  Bell reinvents Heaven to fit human desires he says everyones friends and family will be there and well continue to pursue our hobbies. Bell doesnt have room for anything God may have prepared for His people its all about what humans want. Nevermind that what we want in our earthly lives is usually twisted by sin and that the Bible teaches that well be purified in body and soul when we arrive in Heaven so our desires will be entirely different.  Bell does make a good point that the people most concerned with Heaven in the future are usually the least concerned with doing good now. Shamefully this is often true. God calls us to live holy lives to be good stewards of our time and resources and to love our neighbors. This life definitely does matter its not that our lives here are meaningless just because were going to Heaven.  According to Bell Hell isnt a place of torment the opposite of blissful Heaven but simply an earthly state of living in rejection of God. He says that Hell is nothing more than a violent word describing the consequences of not living Gods way with an emphasis on social ills. Bell seems to ignore the many places where the Bible presents Hell as a real destination (Revelation 20 among others).  Similar to his point about Heaven Bell points out that the people most concerned with Hell in the future are the least concerned with relieving suffering now. I agree to a point we often overlook rather than relieve the suffering of others because its only temporary (whereas the afterlife is eternal). Still its important to retain perspective it really is more important to bring the gospel to people than to bring them material comforts. The soul is more important than the body.  Bells Jesus died to save everyone in history. He says that yes Jesus is the way but not only for a select group of people but for everyone even if they dont know him or consciously follow him. As tolerant and appealing as this is the Bible teaches throughout its pages that God saves certain people and rejects others (Romans 9 among others).  Bell makes a good point that Christians can be desensitized to the story of Jesus and the wonder of the gospel especially if theyve grown up with it. I also liked his point that God isnt a slave driver the Christian life is one of joy not sorrowful sacrifice. We should want to share our joy and the gospel with everyone we meet.  Bell spends a lot of time extracting lessons from the story of the Prodigal Son from Luke 15 and makes several valid points. The older son is a lesson that being good doesnt earn anything and the prodigal son is a lesson that sins cant cause the saved to lose salvation. The parable teaches the futility of people trying to achieve salvation on their own and the mercy of God toward sinners.;Rob Bell

Instead Monica walks you through every aisle of the grocery store and through each meal and snack of the day helping you make healthier choices and answering your burning questions including How often should you eat Which organic foods are worth the extra cost Does cooking vegetables destroy the vitamins Should foods be combined in certain ways for better digestionComplete with grocery shopping lists simple delicious recipes and sample meal plans Nutrition Divas Secrets for a Healthy Dietwill have you feeling healthier looking better than ever before and no longer worrying about what to eat for dinner.;256;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1420944791m10366910.jpg;Nutrition Divas Secrets for a Healthy Diet What to Eat What to Avoid and What to Stop Worrying About;nonfiction;This is my kind of nutrition book It provides just enough data to help you make informed decisions and avoids being a boring nutritionists textbook. Reinagel tells you what to choose and what to avoid when shopping or dining out. She also busts many persistent nutrition myths. I agree with her advice which is to choose fresh whole foods over processed packaged and prepared foods. She advocates preparing meals at home but if choosing packaged foods to choose those with simple recognizable ingredients.  Reinagel says to build a diet around protein and vegetables and says that grains and dairy arent essential to a healthy diet (although they can have a place). She addresses concerns about pesticides antibiotics genetically modified foods and industrial foods but isnt preachy.  Ive been a fan of Reinagels Nutrition Diva podcast for years. This book is basically a collection of the information and advice from the podcast organized into chapters.  Grocery shopping  You can download Nutrition Divas Shopping Guide.  Produce   Vegetables should make up 13  12 of your diet and grocery bill.   Buy  eat least one from each of these groups   green (lettuce spinach etc.)   redorange (tomatoes carrots etc.)   cruciferous (cabbage broccoli cauliflower etc.)   pods (peas green beans etc.)   stinkers (onions garlic etc.)   The benefits of fruits and vegetables far outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure. 50 of exposure to pesticides happens before age 5 so young kids should reduce exposure. Reduce pesticide exposure by 90 by buying organic forms of the Dirty Dozen peaches apples bell peppers celery nectarines strawberries cherries pears grapes (imported) spinach lettuce potatoes.   The freshness of produce has more impact on nutrition than whether its organic.   Frozen produce can be more nutritious than fresh.   Frozen vegetables are usually more nutritious than canned and contain no added salt. The texture and flavor are usually better too. Cans contain BPA which may be a health concern.  Dairy   Dairy isnt necessary but can be a good source of protein calcium and Vitamin D.   Low or nonfat Greek yogurt is higher in protein but lower in calcium than regular yogurt.   Cheeses that are lower in fat and calories partskim ricotta mozzarella feta goat cottage.   About 2 eggsday wont increase cholesterol or risk of disease.  Meat   Red and white meat can both be healthy. Look for welltrimmed cuts.   Avoid cured meats with nitrites.   Deli turkey chicken and roast beef are generally nitritefree but look for lowsodium versions.  Grains   Grains arent essential.   Intact grains are even better than foods made with whole grain flour.   Whole grain breads tortillas etc. should have at least 3 g of fiber per serving.  Sweeteners   Artificial sweeteners arent dangerous.   All sweettasting foods should be consumed in moderation whether naturally or artificially sweet.  Oils   Use extravirgin olive oil as your primary oil. Canola can be substituted but it lacks olive polyphenols.  Nuts and seeds   Raw unsalted nuts and seeds are best. Next best is dryroasted and lightly salted. Worst is honeyroasted.   Nut and seed butters should contain only the nut or seed and maybe some salt. Avoid sugar hydrogenated oils and other additives.  Packaged and prepared foods   Avoid partially hydrogenated oils.   High Fructose Corn Syrup isnt worse than other sugars its the quantity in which its consumed thats the problem.   Protein  DV  carbohydrate  DV (protein  DV  2x protein g).   Fiber  DV  carbohydrate  DV.   Sugar g  fiber g  Caffeine   Caffeine negatively affects the development of babies so pregnant women should limit their intake.   For everyone else a moderate amount of caffeine has some benefits and limited disadvantages. Limit to 34 cups of regular coffee or equivalent.  Additional grocery notes   Cold cuts bacon sausage etc. made from turkey or chicken are often as unhealthy as traditional (fat sodium nitrites). Lowfat versions are usually higher in sodium.   Dried beans are better than canned lower in sodium better flavor and texture and cheaper. Cook and freeze to save prep time.  Diet   Eat breakfast like a king lunch like a prince and supper like a pauper.   Eat 46 servings of grains per day.   Maximum amount of protein to eat each day  1 g for each pound you weigh. Minimum amount of protein  max3.   Going 3 hours between meals can have beneficial effects and doesnt negatively affect blood sugar or metabolism. It takes about 3 days of fasting before the body lowers metabolism.   Eat veggies with healthy fats because the vitamins in veggies are fatsoluble.   Eat as many raw veggies as you want but limit fruit to 2 cupsday due to sugar content.  Breakfast   Eat 2530 of daily calories before lunch (400700 calories).   Have at least 15 g of protein at breakfast to keep hunger at bay.  Lunch   13 of calories (500800).   At least 1 serving of protein.   12 servings of vegetables.   Breadgrains are optional protein and vegetables are better.  Dinner   13 of calories (500800).   At least 1 serving of protein.   12 servings of veggies.   Maybe a grain or starch.  Chinese   eat wonton or hotandsour soup spring roll steamed dish with light sauce plain or brown rice   avoid fried rice egg rolls crispy noodles battered and deepfried items sweetandsour dishes  Mexican   eat grilled chicken or vegetable fajitas fish tacos soft tacos black beans tamales   avoid chips burritos quesadillas taco salad chimichangas hardshell tacos refried beans  Cooking vegetables   Minimize vegetable cooking time and contact with water. Microwaving preserves more nutrients than other methods.   Add fastcooking veggies to soups just prior to serving.  Supplements   A basic daily multivitamin can fill in the gaps but get as much as you can from a healthy diet.   Take a calcium supplement only to cover any gap between dietary intake and recommended amount.   Get 400 IU of Vitamin D daily from food andor supplements.   A fish oil supplement is fine but youll need less Omega3 if you reduce your Omega6 intake. Use and eat products containing olive or canola oil instead of vegetable oils (corn soybean peanut sunflower safflower).  Diets   The most useful form of lowcarb diet is to simply limit foods containing refined flour and sugar.   The Mediterranean Diet is very good.  Exercise Theres no best time of day to exercise. All that matters is calories consumed and burned over the long term.;Monica Reinagel

The length itself isnt the problem but the sustained action is fatiguing because there arent enough calm interludes. I really liked how the chase takes the characters through both the real world and the virtual world of an online video game. I liked this book much more than Anathem (my review) but slightly less than Cryptonomicon (my review).  Stephensons detailed and realistic descriptions of people rooms landscapes and activity make it easy to visualize the story. Im always trying to improve my vocabulary so I appreciated Stephensons wide range of words I paused countless times to look up definitions.  I didnt care about most of the characters but I identified most closely with Richard a techy entrepreneur. The many references to modern technology (especially websites and web services) seemed forced and will age quickly.  I have little sympathy for realworld hackers who write ransomware and other malware so I cant help but wish that Marlon had suffered more. I suppose the entire experience was harrowing to him but I guess I wanted (subconsciously) more serious and tangible consequences. I did like that he went straight in the end.  I wish Stephenson had wrapped up a couple of TRain loose ends. What happened to Richards TRain character Egdod What became of the Wor (War of Realignment);Neal Stephenson

The pace is incredibly slow and theres almost no fighting or other action. It doesnt do much to advance the various plots and it could have been much more succinct it feels like filler material.  I did like some of the chapters about The Wall and was happy to finally see the dragons in action if only briefly. As with the other books I liked the chapters on Jon Tyrion and Daenerys and some on Arya better than the others. I didnt like those about Jaime or especially Cersei. I was indifferent about the new characters.  The further I get into this series the more I find myself reading the books simply to get to the next one and not because I actually enjoy them.

The character development was lacking Beans children struck me as derivations of Ender Peter and Valentine with the attributes of a few other characters mixed in.

Despite the intriguing premise the verbose anecdotes left me screaming I get the point already A better book (or article) would have resulted from taking the appendix (a short practical guide to changing a habit) and adding some of the psychological research and a few brief examples. (After I wrote this review I discovered Charles Duhiggs New York Times article which is basically what I described). The books moral is a respectable one once youre aware of a bad habit its your responsibility to change it.  My favorite case study was the one about Target using predictive analytics and behavioral research to personalize its marketing to each shoppers habits.   A habit is a cue that triggers a routine that results in a reward.   Habits cant be eradicated they can only be replaced.   The Golden Rule of Habit Change to replace a habit keep the cue and reward but replace the routine.   For a habit to stay changed people must believe change is possible. And most often that belief only emerges with the help of a group.   Studies show that willpower is a finite resource its like a muscle that tires with use. Willpower can be increased by exercising selfdiscipline. Increasing selfdiscipline in one area of life increases it in other areas.   To introduce new habits sandwich them between existing ones so they feel familiar.   Habits are most susceptible to being altered when your life changes. Having a baby is the event that produces the most habit changes.;Charles Duhigg

Hansen enumerate the principles for building a truly great enterprise in unpredictable tumultuous and fastmoving times. The new study Great by Choice distinguishes itself from Collinss prior work by its focus on the type of unstable environments faced by leaders today. The new findings The best leaders were more disciplined more empirical and more paranoid. Following the belief that leading in a fast world always requires fast decisions and fast action is a good way to get killed. The great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies. This book is classic Collins contrarian datadriven and uplifting. He and Hansen show convincingly that even in a chaotic and uncertain world greatness happens by choice not by chance.;183;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Great by Choice Uncertainty Chaos and LuckWhy Some Thrive Despite Them All;nonfiction;This book is an engaging exploration of why some companies become great while others dont despite experiencing similar uncertainty chaos and luck. It shows that greatness depends on action and discipline not circumstance or luck. Essentially success depends more on what we do than what the world does to us. This finding is encouraging and empowering since we often feel that were at the mercy of forces outside our control.  I liked the point that one of the most important forms of luck is people luck or Who Luck having the right mentor partner friend etc. Because the right people can be key to success Ive been trying to expand my network and maintain strong relationships.  I read this for the Holland Chamber of Commerce Business Book Group. Jim Collins is known for his thorough research and this is no exception. I liked this book more than Good to Great (see my review) because its more about individuals than companies so I found it easier to apply the lessons to myself and my web design business OptimWise.  Core behaviors of 10Xers  Fanatic discipline they have relentless focus independence of mind and extreme consistency.  Empirical creativity they base decisions on empirical evidence not conventional wisdom or authority figures.  Productive paranoia theyre hypervigilant of changes in their environment and respond with preparation and productive action.  Level 5 ambition they balance personal humility and professional will. Theyre ambitious for a cause greater than themselves.  20 mile march  Hit specified performance markers consistently over the long term. This requires high performance in hard times and holding back in good times.  Fire bullets then cannonballs  Once youve met your industrys innovation threshold being innovative doesnt matter much.  Bullets are lowrisk lowcost tests to see what will work. Based on the resulting empirical evidence concentrate your resources and fire a cannonball (a higherrisk highercost action). Be creative but validate your ideas. Then keep 20 Mile Marching to make the most of the big success.  Leading above the Death Line  Prepare for bad events by building cash reserves and taking other precautions.  Pay attention to risk and respond to changes.  The sign of mediocrity isnt unwillingness to change but chronic inconsistency (always changing with every new trend being controlled rather than taking control).  Not all time in life is equal. Life serves up some moments that count much more than other moments. We will all face moments when the quality of our performance matters much more than other moments.  SMaC  Create a SMaC recipe a Specific Methodical and Consistent success formula and amend it only rarely. Think of the US Constitution and its amendments.  Return on luck  The authors define luck as a significant unpredictable event.  10Xers didnt have more good or bad luck but they had a better return on luck (ROL).  The question isnt whether youll have luck (good or bad) but what youll do with it. The problem isnt a lack of good luck its failing to execute on it.;James C. Collins Morten T. Hansen

It tells how to find inspiration produce art improve your craft and connect with likeminded people. I enjoyed the sketches but I found the content a bit too shallow.  I liked the tips on finding inspiration (look to your heroes disconnect from the Internet start a swipe file to save thoughts and observations etc.). I also liked the advice to create art in analog form then edit digitally. Why Computers are good for editing ideas but not for generating them because you start editing too quickly.  As a web designer I take many of the steps advocated in the book including taking walks going to the library using a calendar keeping a log and blogging. One thing that Kleon practices but I struggle with is enjoy captivity. Kleon tells how he deliberately seeks time to disconnect from the Internet and carries a book pen and notepad to encourage creativity during such times. I try to disconnect while on walks or while spending time with my wife and daughter but I almost always listen to podcasts during walks and waits and pull out my phone too often when with my family.  I read this because it was recommended by a friend who runs a successful local web and app development company.  Notes   All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely original. When people call something original its usually just because they dont know the references or original sources. William Ralph Inge calls originality undetected plagiarism.   Youre ready.

Tapping into the simple but powerful model that his firm The Table Group has been built on Lencioni presents what may be his most engaging humorous audiobook yet.Getting Naked tells the remarkable story of a management consultant who is trying desperately to merge two firms with very different approaches to serving clients. One relies on vulnerability and complete transparency the other focuses on proving its competence and protecting its reputation for intellectual prowess. In the process of managing the merger the consultant is forced to learn lifechanging lessons that prove to be as relevant as they are painful.As he does in his other audiobooks Lencioni provides readers with concepts that are accessible and compelling. He explains the three fears that provoke service providers to unknowingly sabotage their ability to build trust and loyalty. And as always Lencioni provides a practical approach for overcoming those fears.;220;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1330256187m13500964.jpg;Getting Naked A Business Fable about Shedding the Three Fears That Sabotage Client Loyalty;nonfiction;This book tells how consultants can forge better client relationships by being vulnerable. Vulnerable or naked service is characterized by uncommon levels of humility selflessness and transparency for the clients good. It tells how to be more like team members than vendors. The result is work thats more enjoyable profitable and rewarding.  It explains three fears that hold consultants back and how to overcome these fears. Written as a fable its short but still longer than necessary.  I agreed with most of the advice. The main point that I questioned was the recommendation to start consulting in the initial meeting before arranging an agreement or fees. I can only see that working for certain consulting services and if the client is prequalified.  I look forward to using the advice to improve the way we consult in my web design agency OptimWise.  Notes  [E]ven though clients require us to be competent enough to meet their needs it is ultimately our honesty humility and selflessness that will endear us to them and allow them to trust and depend on us.  Fear 1 Fear of losing the business  Dont worry about closing the deal or losing the client. Be so focused on the clients interests that you stop worrying about repercussions.  Clients want to know youre more interested in helping them than in making money.  Consult dont sell. Give away the business.  At initial meeting be a consultant not a salesman. Help dont sell. Skip the sales process.  Dont start with presentations and proposals. Instead ask about prospects issues and brainstorm. Do collaborative realtime client research rather than preparing an answer ahead of time. Dont try to outsmart the client just start consulting.  Dont tell what youd do if hired just start serving as if theyve hired you.  Dont bring up fees unless they ask.  Once a prospect shows a real interest in becoming a client focus on their issues and determining if theyd be a good client before jumping to sign a deal. Bringing up the deal can shift focus from their issues to what you want out of the arrangement.  Dont be afraid of helping too much during initial sales call. Most clients wont use your advice without hiring you. Those that do would be bad clients anyway.  Err on the side of the client when it comes to fees to build a longterm relationship.  Tell the kind truth  Give feedback with the empathy and concern of a friend.  If youre not willing to tell a client the kind truth why should they pay you  Fear 2 Fear of being embarrassed (intellectual pride)  Ask dumb questions  Dont pretend to know than you know more than you do.  Make dumb suggestions  Clients dont mind sifting through some bad suggestions if theyre offered with good intentions.  Clients want to hear all your suggestions and want transparency and honesty more than intelligence.  Celebrate your mistakes  Admit it was a bad idea and laugh.  Fear 3 Fear of feeling inferior (preserving social standing related to client)  Clients trust and respect service providers who act as servants.  Misc.  Once you build a relationship with the client they rarely mention your fees. Of course some cant afford you.  A bad client is worse than no client because they prevent you from finding good clients dont give good references and make you dread work.  This method will result in getting most of your business from referrals and warm leads.  This method is less professional less sophisticated less rigorous and less systematic but more effective. Clients will love you and refer others.  Dont tell clients how to run their business or try to convince them that you know more than them.;Patrick Lencioni

The plethora of references to scifi video games comics and fantasy brought back a lot of fun memories. The story starts slow but ramps up and the plot becomes more engaging. Overall I felt that the story seemed hollow and lacking a deeper meaning.  I thought that things went too well for Wade especially in the OASIS. I thought he was unrealistically good at the games and 1980s trivia.  Even though I only spent 4 years in the 1980s (Im much more familiar with the 1990s) I did get most of the cultural references. I disliked the juvenile profanity I realize its part of story but I wouldve preferred it without. I also disliked the jabs at Christianity and God and Im glad they were few and had little effect on the story.  Wil Wheaton makes an excellent narrator for the audiobook.;Ernest Cline Wil Wheaton
1167;13574985;5;50548;1937557049;Cofounder of Mule Design and raconteur Mike Monteiro wants to help you do your job better. From contracts to selling design from working with clients to working with each other this brief book is packed with knowledge you cant afford not to know.;135;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1333415533m13574985.jpg;Design Is a Job;nonfiction;This succinct book is densely packed with sage business advice for designers (especially web designers). Monteiro rightly calls it a guide to making a living as a designer and shows that he has a lot of experience in the industry. Its quite funny I laughed out loud several times. My favorite chapters were Getting Clients Choosing the Right Clients Charging for Your Work and Working with Contracts.  I especially liked Monteiros description of the role of design. He says that designers arent artists designers use art to solve clients problems. Clients have goals and they need designers to provide the strategy and problemssolving to achieve them. Therefore clients cant simply tell designers what to do they must explain their goals and leave the designing to designers.  Monteiro says communication is critical and since tone of voice and body language can make such a difference its best to meet with clients in person. When thats not possible do a video conference or phonevoice call. Subtleties in communication are lost in email.  He makes a good point that people dont inherently know how to be good design clients they have good intentions but need designers to guide them. I also liked his stance on pricing charge for value not time and charge as much as you honestly can.  I read this book because it was recommended in several places including the article Getting Clients on A List Apart Episode 19 of the Pagebreak Podcast and on Code Poet.  Monteiro is fairly general in his advice I wouldve appreciated more specific strategies for marketing selling and pricing. For those I recommend SitePoints The Web Design Business Kit (my review) and Starting Your Career as a Freelance Web Designer (my review).  Getting Clients   Be pleasant not nice. Clients hire you to solve problems not be their friend. Be politely straightforward.   Referrals source of over 90 of work.   RFPs contact the person behind the RFP. Create a relationship to bypass the RFP process.   Outbound contact go through your network dont cold call.   Advertising at most may help you seem familiar to a potential client whos been referred to you.   Conferences meet potential clients and peers.  Choosing the Right Clients   Good clients are open to your solutions to their problems they arent committed to their own solutions.   Designers provide strategy and problemsolving not just production.   Never work for free. Provide a discount if you must but show actual cost on invoices.   People dont inherently know how to be good clients you need to guide them.  Charging for Your Work   Charge as much as you can and deliver an honest value.   When explaining that the cost of a website depends on the clients needs use cars or houses as analogies.   Clients buy your work not your time so charge based on the value of the work to them.   Mention ballpark prices early to avoid sticker shock.   Create the proposal with the client listing each partys responsibilities.   Present a proposal dont send it. Present with confidence and using costs based on research.   Never lower a price without taking something away and explaining the lost benefit.   The secrets to getting the price you want for your work are having done the homework to know youre asking for the right thing the confidence to ask for it and the willingness to walk away when you cant get it.  Working with Contracts   Freelancers should have a lawyer create a solid master contract then ask for guidance when necessary.   Keep contracts and SOWs separate. One contract can cover multiple SOWs.  Contract elements   Intellectual property (IP) transfer on full payment   Terminationkill fee   Deliverables acceptance language if client isnt happy with work they need to give you a chance to address it. If they fire you you keep the work.   Do not include indemnity for the client because they could hold you responsible for losses if theyre sued.   Do not include any guarantees that the design will meet the goals.  Sticking to Your Process   The client has a goal you provide the plan to get there.   Meet with clients in person whenever possible. Phonevoice call is next best. Tone of voice and body language matter.  Presenting Design   Dont ask for subjective feedback dont ask do you like it Ask for specific objective feedback about whether the design meets the goals.  Managing Feedback   Dont let the client design. Instead talk to them about the problem theyre trying to solve.  Getting Your Money   Tie payments to clear milestones events that you control and can be put on a calendar. Dont tie payments to metrics. Dont use the site launch as a payment milestone unless you alone control the launch date.   Divide projects into 3 or 4 payments.;Mike Monteiro Erik Spiekermann

I liked how Bernard grew in complexity from a seemingly onedimensional character as you came to understand his motives and situation. I wish the story told more about Holston and Allison.  As a former IT professional I found the IT departments role interesting.  Some parts were annoyingly unrealistic. I grew tired of Juliettes close calls with death and several scenes dragged on for example Juliettes trip to and into Silo 17 (The Unraveling) and Juliettes underwater ordeal (The Stranded).  My review of the Silo series.  Quotes  He stuffed a fistful of deadly rounds in his pocket thinking how each one could end an individual life and understanding why such things were forbidden. Killing a man should be harder than waving a length of pipe in their direction. It should take long enough for ones conscience to get in the way.  It means we cant change whats already happened but we can have an impact on what happens next.  Some men are like a virus. Unless you want to see a plague break out you inoculate the silo against them. You remove them.  And Peter had a decision to make. Was he the final law or did he owe something to those who put him in place Did he do what was right or what was expected of him It was so easy to do the latter but Peter Billings was a good man.;Hugh Howey

As Bilbo Baggins takes his final voyage to the Undying Lands he must say goodbye to Middleearth. Poignant and lyrical the song is both a longing to set forth on his ultimate journey and a tender farewell to friends left behind.Pauline Bayness jewellike illustrations lushly depict both this final voyage and scenes from The Hobbit as Bilbo remembers his first journey while he prepares for his last.;32;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1351006239m16071614.jpg;Bilbos Last Song;fantasy paranormal;This short poem by Tolkien is Bilbos last song which he sang at the Grey Havens before leaving Middleearth. There are two sequences of illustrations large pictures of his trip to the Grey Havens and on the ship and smaller pictures from The Hobbit. The large pictures start in Rivendell and end when with him seeing Tol Eressea from the bow of the ship.  As a huge Tolkien fan I felt quite nostalgic while reading this. The illustrations are by Pauline Baynes famous for illustrating The Chronicles of Narnia and they have a real Faerie feel to them.;J.R.R. Tolkien Pauline Baynes

It walks through several lessons the meaning and purpose of life providence and free will mercy and pity materialism and greed pride and selfsacrifice and love. According to Pearce The Hobbits deepest meaning is that God is the Ultimate Master who directs all and turns evil to serve the greater good.  Its wellwritten. It goes in order of The Hobbit and that works well. I think Pearce digs a little too deep for meaning in some cases making connections that may have been beyond Tolkiens intent.  I prefer this to The Christian World of the Hobbit. Its deeper and Pearce seems to know Tolkiens works more thoroughly than Brown (based on my reading only these two books by the authors).  Despite the title its not limited to The Hobbit it talks about The Lord of the Rings almost as much. Dont read this if you havent finished both The Hobbit and LotR as there are many spoilers  Regarding the conflict between good and evil throughout human history (before the end of the world) Tolkien said (Letters 255)Actually I am a Christian and indeed a Roman Catholic so that I do not expect history to be anything but a long defeat though it contains (and in legend may contain more clearly and movingly) some samples or glimpses of final victory.;Joseph Pearce
1174;16202533;4;50548;;People who make websites sometimes say that their clients are unreasonable. People who pay for websites sometimes say that the professionals they hire dont understand business and cant stick to deadlines. A project manager is right in the middle  and a shrewd project manager can clear up misconceptions in both directions while inspiring everyone involved to work together creatively.;0;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1358593811m16202533.jpg;A Practical Guide to Managing Web Projects;nonfiction;An informative and practical guide to successfully managing website and web app projects. Its clearly based on firsthand experience with many projects. Its a bit dry its not as engaging or entertaining as it couldve been.  I found it well worth reading because I spend a lot of time managing website projects in my web design agency OptimWise. I read it because I saw the founder of another web agency reading it. Following are my notes.  Selling Web Work  Read Bloodhounding Budgets.  Kickoff  Requirements sorting Write stakeholder objectives on index cards. Give colored dot stickers to everyone (buildside and clientside). Let each person add up to three dots to each idea where more dots indicates greater importance. Sort objectives accordingly.  Requirements and Scope  Stakeholder interviews  1. What are your responsibilities  2. From the customers perspective what would success look like  3. What financial goals do you personally hope the website will achieve  4. How will your internal processes change if this project succeeds  5. How do you hope the work and skills of you and your team will change for the better after the site goes live  6. Just hypothetically what would complete failure look like  7. Anything else  User Research  Methods   look at the websites of competitors   conduct web surveys   look at other published research (books websites and market surveys)  [T]hink about putting the largest part of your time and money into an oldfashioned technique asking people what they think oneonone.  Ask interview subjects about how they feel about their daily tasks as theyre accomplished. These emotional states can tell you how a process can be improved or how an online tool can help.  Ask about competitors. Ask about the subjects experience of your clients brand. Ask about what comes to mind when they think about leaders in the industry. Ask general questions about what websites they consider to be easy or hard to use useful or useless.  Wireframing  Rank info based on user preference not client preference. For example about us content isnt important for most users.  Graphic Design  If you start at the page level to present your designs clients may feel that they dont have enough choices to make. Starting with smaller textual or visual modules will make it easier to elicit the feedback that you need. Present the full pages once the overall visual direction has been established. This way youll only spend the time building one set of pages not three.  Time to Build  Rather than starting with the big visual elements on the page [masthead navigation footer] begin the visual design and the page build with the fundamental unit of content. This is different for different sites  a magazine site might be about the article text and a travel site might be about the booking detail. ... make the fundamental content unit easy to use and attractive in the page. Build the sidebars and footers and callouts in relation to the fundamental content.  Time to Test  People may try to add ideas during testing. Remind them that the time to evaluate the success of particular screens features and calls to action is after the site launches. Youll use instinct sure but also numbers and metrics to show whats working and what needs to be improved.  Write down what people find and those suggestions will be the first to go into a Phase 2 of the project. Just before launch ... isnt the time to secondguess. This is the time to make everything work as smoothly as possible ...  Social Strategy  You can add social features (such as a Facebook Like button) to the site though you might find that people are more strongly motivated to follow your websites calls to action if you dont give them such an easy way to engage.  Measurement  Move beyond page views and visits to judge the effect of the website on the more lasting relationships between people and organisations. This will probably require more qualitative research like surveys.  So Did We Win  Elements of case studies   description of problems solved   details about the process you used to solve the problems   details about the design and functionality that solved the problems   positive reviews or awards   quotes from client stakeholders and the website team   show the evolution of your thinking and design  Now What  Look for ways to follow up. Look at your Phase 2 log and the things you knocked out of scope. Consider creating a brief while the knowledge is fresh even if there isnt immediate budget for the work. The client may hire you for it in the future or make a referral.;Breandan Knowlton

Where has the mud blood and blasted landscape of No mans Land gone2015 Madison Wisconsin. Cop Monica Jansson has returned to the burnedout home of one Willis Linsay a reclusive and some said mad others dangerous scientist. It was arson but as is often the way the firemen seem to have caused more damage than the fire itself. Stepping through the wreck of a house theres no sign of any human remains but on the mantelpiece Monica finds a curious gadget  a box containing some wiring a threeway switch and a...potato. It is the prototype of an invention that Linsay called a stepper. An invention he put up on the web for all the world to see and use an invention that would to change the way mankind viewed his world Earth for ever. And thats an understatement if ever there was one......because the stepper allowed the person using it to step sideways into another America another Earth and if you kept on stepping you kept on entering even more Earths...this is the Long Earth. Its not our Earth but one of chain of parallel worlds lying side by side each differing from its neighbour by really very little (or actually quite a lot). Its an infinite chain offering steppers an infinite landscape of infinite possibilities. And the further away you travel the stranger  and sometimes more dangerous  the Earths get. The sun and moon always shine the basic laws of physics are the same. However the chance events which have shaped our particular Earth such as the dinosaurkiller asteroid impact might not have happened and things may well have turned out rather differently.But until Willis Linsay invented his stepper only our Earth hosted mankind...or so we thought.

The plot isnt engaging and I didnt care about the characters (although I found Lobsang at least interesting). I struggled through until chapter 41 then gave up.  I felt like Joshua in this exchange  Lobsang Im painting a picture for you here Joshua.  Joshua Its kind of a dull picture Lobsang.  The story is about a tour of millions of Earths each a branch on the probability tree. Evolution occurred differently on each. Only a few produced humanoids and only the original Earth (Datum Earth) produced humans. Besides the main storyline you also learn of humanitys colonization of the Long Earth and how it affected Datum Earth. There are glimpses into pioneer life hunting gathering farming growing towns economics commerce and politics.  Lobsang gives a good description of the nature of the Long Earth Joshua always remember you have not travelled back in time or forward. You have travelled far across the contingency tree of the possible on a planet where dramatic but quasirandom extinction events periodically obliterate much of the family of life leaving room for evolutionary innovation. On each Earth however the outcomes will differ by a little or a lot.  The narrator does a great job.;Terry Pratchett Stephen Baxter Michael Fenton Stevens

Its a heros journey pitting good against evil. Theres a large world of creatures cultures and places and glimpses into deep history.  Some parts dont seem to contribute to the story but perhaps they set the stage for subsequent books. The final conflict is actionpacked but bizarre (deliberately so it seems).  My favorite characters were Moiraine Thom Loial and the Green Man. I didnt really care the other main characters including Rand the protagonist.  Im a huge Tolkien fan so I couldnt help comparing this to his works (primarily The Lord of the Rings) and this book is inferior.

It instantly became one of my favorite marketing books. I agree with Newmans approach it fits the way I like to market services. He recommends content marketing (what he calls trusted advisor marketing) over coldcalling and aimless networking. He advises not wasting much time following up with prospects who arent ready to buy. He recommends a combination of company branding and personal branding.  Im always seeking to improve the marketing of my web design business (OptimWise) and to help clients with their marketing. I liked Newmans ingredients for a credible website (see Part 13 below). The book is full of other marketing advice that you can use in marketing your small business.  I read this because it was recommended by Jim Schoettle Executive Director of Development at the Michigan West Coast Chamber of Commerce.  Part 1 Marketing Rocks  Ask yourself What value have I added to my prospects world to earn the right to invite them to the conversation and offer my solutions to their problems and challenges  Do you want to make more sales to strangers Or do you really want more people to recognize respect and request you by name when they have a need If thats your goal then trusted advisor marketing (content marketing) is for you.  Part 2 Its About Them Really   How does your productservice compare to competitors based on the criteria that your customers use to make decisions   Ask prospects What are your priorities when looking at productsservices like mine   Dont talk about your how (methods inputs approaches) talk about their why (meets outcomes desires).   Good marketing is not about your business. Its about how your business is different valuable and meaningful to customers. Its about why people should do business with you and only you because youre the expert in your field.  Developing Your Thought Leadership Platform  1. Go with what you know your education background experience passions skills.  2. Tie into a common problem evergreen challenge or growing trend. Examples improving sales improving performance and productivity.  3. Figure out what your prospects are already buying and position your solutions in the same category.  4. Markettest your new messages principles and angles informally with business partners.  5. Call or meet with actual buyers (industry contacts clients prospects) to get their reactions. Dont sell just run ideas by them.  Why People Buy from Me Worksheet with example answers from a marketer  Why should I buy your productservice   Because youre terrible at marketing.   Because you dont make time for marketing.   Because without proactive marketing youre the best kept secret at what you do.  Why should I buy from you   Because of powerful testimonials.   Because were selective in who we work with.  Why should I buy at your price   If youre not comfortable spending big money with me why would you expect your prospects to spend big money with you   You shouldnt work with me if marketing and growing your business is not a serious priority for you.   You can spend less and youll get less. And you can spend more and youll still get less because I overdeliver (read the testimonials).  Why should I buy now   Because its rare that I have openings in my client roster. You can get in now or typically wait 3 to 6 months.   Because the longer you delay getting your marketing house in order the longer youll stay in a state of confusion inaction and being overwhelmed.   What would be like if your next years revenues were much like your last years If youre okay with that theres probably no reason for us to work together.   Because the money youre not making week after week month after month is a larger number than the money youd be investing to bring your revenues to where youd like them to be.   Because you want to stop the feast or famine revenue cycle and get a proactive handling your marketing process before you hit your next dip.   Because someone you know and respect recommended we chat.  Part 3 Learn to Speak Prospect   Read your marketing copy. If you wouldnt say it out loud replace it with what you would say.   Prove to them you understand what theyre up against. Take your positive features and benefits flip them around to become negative conditions theyre suffering with right now. Then you flip back again with specific pain relief statements that make each of those negatives go away.   Talk to clients and prospects and record their complaints.   Position your offering not in terms of saved money or earned money not in terms of less wasted time or more free time but simply in terms of more control and less chaos. More time great more money exciting more control priceless.  Identifying Your Best Buyers  1. Think about your best clients and customers. What makes them your best  2. What are their job titles Industries Affiliations Traits Values  3. What problems do they have What solutions do they seek (State this in their own words)  4. Where else have they looked to solve this problem  5. Why hasnt that worked for them  6. What do they hate about your category of productservice or your industry  7. How can you position yourself as the Ahh at last solution  Part 4 Expert Positioning  Top 3 sources of new business  1. Warm calls to existing clients.  2. Speaking at conferences and trade shows.  3. Running seminars and events.  Part 8 Get Better Prospects   Network with people who already know you like you or have done business with you.   Networking isnt about telling more people what you do its about getting people who already know you to share opportunities where you can be helpful to each other.   Create list of advocates (5 to 25 people who can make positive connections for you) and communicate or connect with them in a simple way every 30 days (ideally but 60 to 90 days works too).   To maximize sales follow up on leads within 15 minutes. These leads are much more likely to stop looking at competitors.  Network smarter   Have onetoone coffee or lunch aiming to befriend. They may become a business connection but thats not the focus.   If you network with strangers make 23 coffee or lunch dates with interesting people.   Ask every happy client for just one referral then contact that person and use the clients name.   Create a list of the exact types of target prospects. Focus networking only on those people (or those who can refer you to them).  Part 9 Eliminate Roadblocks   Address the question arent we already doing this Show that they arent or arent doing it enough with credible research stats quotes.   To filter quickly on cold calls ask if they plan to shop for the service you offer within the next year. If no its not worth talking to them this year since you wont convince them. Check back in a year.   Every marketing piece you send out should be too good to deletethrowaway even if prospects dont do business with you. Make each piece educational shareable referenceable.  Four arrows diagram   With your prospects products services and process in one color and your service in third position in contrasting color. This shows that youre offering closes a gap and is the perfect fit.   Their 1st process  Their 2nd process  Your productservice  Their final process  Stop Wasting Your Time Following Up   If youre focused on prospects who are actively seeking to solve their problem youll get their attention the first or second attempt.   Checking in gets annoying fast and can hurt chances at future sales.  Part 13 Your 21Day Marketing Launch Plan  To search for places to speak use a query with these keywords [profession] [annual] [convention] [conference] [state] [conference] [city] [state] [year].

Its current and practical while still presenting timeless principles. It covers several topics but my favorite tips dealt with time management. My wife read this book and then recommended it to me knowing that I spend much of my day as a web designer juggling creative work and communication.  Each chapter is quite short (310 pages) and is written by a different authors. I found some of the sections repetitive. The chapters are separated by motivational quotes.  Before reading this book my workdays started with checking email and social media. Id then close them and focus on project work for most of the day checking email and social media two or more times before the end of the day. Inevitably Id end up spending a lot of time on unimportant tasks. Immediately after finishing this book I started doing important creative work for the first few hours of each day ignoring email and social media. So far this has made me much more productive so Ill continue to tweak my schedule to give more priority to focused creative time.  Notes   Do creative work first and reactive work (such as dealing with messages) second. Block off a large part of each day for creative work on your priorities ignoring outside communication.   Limit your daily todo list (suggestion Postit note size) and dont keep adding to it during the day. Put new tasks on future lists.   Our bodies follow ultradian rhythms 90minute periods at the end of which we reach the limits of our capacity to work at the highest level.   If you can its best to find a good stopping point on a project  one that frees your mind from nagging questions  before moving on to another task. This provides mental closure so you can focus on the next task. Exceptions problemsolving and brainstorming which can benefit from switching focus.   Create windows of nonstimulation in your day. Think digest and plan.   The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say no to almost everything.

Several questions arent directly related to the creation and evolution debate (biological geological or cosmological evolution). Several deal with political issues such as climate change and environmentalism or theological issues such as atheism and the image of God.  I liked the chapters What Are Some of the Best Evidences in Science of a Young Creation What about Beneficial Mutations and Is Speciation Evidence for Creation or Evolution  Notes  Do Plants and Leaves Die  The Hebrew word for die or death is used only in relation to humans and animals not plants. Bacteria and fungi are probably also excluded from the Hebrew definition of alive.  Cavemen ... Really  Neanderthal DNA is 99.7 identical to modern humans. Approximately 80 genes differ. Neanderthals and Denisovans have less genetic difference from modern humans than two modern chip species have from each other.  What Did the Reformers Believe about the Age of the Earth  The literal reading of Genesis 1 was supported by Luther Calvin Belgic Confession Zanchis Confession of Faith Irish Articles Westminster Confession of Faith.  What Are Some of the Best Evidences in Science of a Young Creation  1. Very little sediment on the seafloor  At present rate the average 1300 feet would accumulate in under 12 million years.  2. Bent rock layers  Layers are bent and folded without fracturing which can only happen with soft and pliable rock not hardened rock.  3. Soft tissue in fossils  Example T. Rex found in Hell Creek Formation in Montana.  4. Faint sun paradox  At present rate sun wouldve warmed Earth to only 3degF 3.5 billion years ago too cold for most life.  5. Rapidly decaying magnetic field  Fields energy halves approximately every 1456 years so Earth cant be older than 20000 years.  6. Helium in radioactive rocks  Helium is present in zircon crystals even though it shouldve leaked out in under 100000 years.  7. Carbon14 in fossils coal diamonds  C14 has been found in ancient fossils coal and diamonds despite halflife of 5730 years. None should remain after a few hundred thousand years.  8. Shortlived comets  Given the loss rate comets can only last a few million years. Their prevalence points to a young solar system. Theres no evidence for suggested sources of new comets.  9. Very little salt in the sea  At todays rates present sodium levels would be reached in 42 million years (62 million with most generous estimates). Earth is supposedly much older.  10. DNA in ancient bacteria  Lazarus bacteria (supposedly 250 million years old) have DNA very similar to modern bacteria and the DNA was intact (even though it shouldnt last more than 1 million years).  What about Living Fossils  Creation geologists believe Paleozoic represents early Flood Mesozoic represents later Flood and Cenozoic represents postFlood. Pleistocene probably begins after Tower of Babel.  What Is the State of the Canopy Model  The canopy model has several biblical and scientific problems.  The necessity for a waterbased canopy about the earth is not directly stated in the text. It is an interpretation of the text. The waters above could refer to clouds or something in space.  Genesis 114 says sun moon stars were made in the expanse so it cant be part of Earths atmosphere. Genesis 120 says creatures flew in the face of the expanse so it probably includes aspects of the atmosphere and space.  A vapor canopy would have had a greenhouse effect that would result in toohigh temperatures.  Longevity and the large size of many creatures before and after the Flood is better explained by genetics then a canopy.  What about Creation Flood and Language Division Legends  Many cultures have legends of language division similar to the Tower of Babel in addition to legends of creation and a flood.  What about Environmentalism  When God calls creation very good in Genesis 131 this does not entail that it was terminally perfect but that it was the perfect setting for mans probation and for his exercising the imago Dei [Image of God].  What about Distant Starlight Models  Potential solutions to the distant starlight problem include time dilation near Earth during creation week acceleration of starlight on Day 4 (as plant development was accelerated on Day 3) and a miracle.  What about Beneficial Mutations  Some mutations have beneficial outcomes in certain environments but they dont lead to the origin of novel traits necessary for macroevolution. Beneficial mutations are alterations of preexisting traits or losses of traits.  Sometimes genes fuse but the genes are preexisting and no new functionality is introduced.  Gene duplication and subsequent mutation result in adaptation not macroevolution. The functionality in the duplicated mutated gene remains the same.  Is Speciation Evidence for Creation or Evolution  Losing the ability to interbreed each new species would have less genetic variability less ability to meet changes in its existing environment and less ability to explore new environments  all suggesting decline and demise rather than the expansion of genetic potential.  Speciation is moving in the wrong direction to support ... moleculestoman evolution. Speciation produces only variation within kinds as a result of the subdivision andor alteration of preexisting genetic variability.  Are Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) Wrong  Genetic engineering can be defended by the Biblical examples of Jacobs artificial selection in Genesis 30 ram breeds in Deuteronomy 3214 and Pauls grafting analogy in Romans 11.  The number of actual scientific reports in the scientific literature is very small that say GMOs cause cancer or other disease.  The Image of God  Image of God includes ability to know love and worship God to think reason and choose between right and wrong.  At the Fall the image of God was tarnished and broken ... we remain rational spiritual beings but our rationality and spirituality no longer impart a true knowledge of God. Humanity continues to reflect a unique dignity as Gods imagebearers that no other creature enjoys but the dignity is damaged significantly by the consequences of sin.  Christ is called the image of God in 2 Corinthians 434 Colossians 11516 Hebrews 113.  Salvation restores the image of God. Colossians 3910 Romans 829 1 Corinthians 1549 2 Corinthians 318.;Ken Ham

1186;18266070;2;50548;1478952725;In his 1 bestselling books The Tipping Point Blink and Outliers Malcolm Gladwell has explored the ways we understand and change our world. Now he looks at the complex and surprising ways the weak can defeat the strong the small can match up against the giant and how our goals (often culturally determined) can make a huge difference in our ultimate sense of success. Drawing upon examples from the world of business sports culture cuttingedge psychology and an array of unforgettable characters around the world David and Goliathis in many ways the most practical and provocative book Malcolm Gladwell has ever written.;0;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1421011560m18266070.jpg;David and Goliath;nonfiction;Gladwell reveals how advantages can spring from apparent disadvantages how underdogs (Davids) can surpass giants (Goliaths). He backs his insights with data from a variety of studies. As with his other books I quickly tired of the long anecdotes getting the point long before he was finished telling his stories.  Gladwell explains how the invertedU curve applies to many areas. The invertedU curve graphs how adding resources (such as money or people) only provides a benefit to a point after that point additional resources are a detriment. He shows how this fits school class size (both too small and too large are bad) wealth and parenting (both too poor and too rich are bad) and crime and punishment (both too lenient and too strict are bad).  Another main point is that of near misses. Gladwell describes how during the London blitz there were remote misses (bombs that landed far away from a person) and near misses (bombs that landed close to a person but didnt kill them). Remote misses instilled fear but near misses decreased fear and instilled courage because people thought of themselves as survivors or even invincible. In the same way challenges in peoples lives can be near misses increasing their fortitude.  Notes   Some advantages come from having material resources. Others come from the absence of material resources. Underdogs win as often they do because the latter are equal to the former.   Class size has no effect on student performance in the US according to multiple studies.  Fish in ponds   Although there are advantages to the big pond even if youre a small fish there are also advantages to being a big fish in a small pond. Being a big fish in a small pond maximizes ones chances of success.   We compare ourselves to people around us not the rest of the world. This affects how we view ourselves.   A student at a lessprestigious university has a higher chance of academic success than the same student at a highly prestigious university because highly prestigious schools demoralize all but the best students (since they compare themselves to the elite). Its easier to succeed being a big fish in a small pond.   The suicide rate is higher in countries that report higher levels of happiness than those that report lower levels of happiness because people in happier countries feel more abnormal.   Affirmative action has been largely unsuccessful because it places students at a higher level than they would otherwise achieve increasing the chances that theyll become discouraged and underachieve. It puts small fish in big ponds.   Capitalization learning getting good at something that youre naturally given. Compensation learning being forced to compensate for something that has been taken away (example a dyslexic becoming a good listener and memorizer). Compensation learning is really hard requiring you to overcome limitations. Those who can overcome limitations are better off than they would have been otherwise because what is learned out of necessity is more powerful than learning that comes easily.   Powerauthority must be seen as legitimate or it has the opposite effect.;Malcolm Gladwell

There are plenty of examples mostly from national and global businesses but a few from small businesses. Its clear that the author has a lot of experience. The book is very convincing about the value of a brand. One of the main points is that brand quality has more effect on sales than product quality.  I listened to the free audiobook after hearing Raymond Aaron on BNI Podcast Episode 322 Branding  Networking.  Notes   Branding has a more positive effect on your business than your products quality.   Nobody wants your product they want the product of your product. They want the end result.   When you extend your product line give each product a new brand. Adding multiple products to the same brand dilutes it.   Consumer Reports has found no relationship between product quality and sales but it has between brand quality and sales.   Myth branding is less important now than in the past. Fact branding has never been more important. Business today is a buying culture buyers may not go through a salesperson.   Myth branding is deceptive. Fact branding cant be deceptive its what others say about you. Therefore you must ensure that your product and customer service are excellent.   A USP creates differentiation. It tells why people should pick you over competitors. A brand creates memories it tells people what the experience of buying from your company is like. A USP provides a rational reason a brand provides everything else. A USP is leftbrain a brand is rightbrain.;Raymond Aaron

Its a prequel to Wool telling how deceit and abuse of power brought the world to the state its in in Wool. Its gripping like Wool but its even more bleak chilling and sad. The scope is much larger. I enjoyed the gradual revelation of past events. I felt like Donald of whom the book says He was beginning to see it the entire picture zooming out of the schematic until the whole was laid bare.  The sense of morality and consequences is even stronger than in Wool. Several times I thought of the quote All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.  He certainly has flaws but for some reason I connected more with Donald than with Juliette in Wool. I thought Jimmys sections were too many and too long. Like Wool I found some details farfetched such as how long things last in the silos. Overall though I liked this book even better than Wool and I cant wait to read Dust.  My review of the Silo series.  Quotes  Donald was verging on the sad realization that humanity had been thrown to the brink of extinction by insane men in positions of power following one another each thinking the others knew where they were going.  Thoughts and memories reluctantly assembled like exhausted soldiers roused from their bunks in the middle of the night and told to form ranks in the freezing rain.  It was all according to protocol. The system could be trustedit was designed to just go. All anyone needed to do was their own job and let others handle the rest.  Donald was reminded of how each silo has a mayor for shaking hands and keeping up appearances just as the world of before had presidents who came and went. Meanwhile it was the men in the shadows who wielded the true power those whose terms had no limits.  It was supposed to be people who died and cultures that lasted. Now it was the other way around.;Hugh Howey

For example whats the story behind the dome What happened to the rest of the world What happens to the other silos in the future How did Thurman survive going outside Fortunately I found Hugh Howeys answers to a few of these questions after I finished the series.  As a Christian I didnt like how the church members were portrayed as not only mentally unbalanced but outright evil. I hope Howey was trying to show how people can corrupt religion to suit their own purposes and not intending to make a commentary that Christianity itself is corrupt.  My review of the Silo series.  Quotes  You were just doing your job she answered him. And then she thought just how powerful that sentiment was how far down a nasty road that could take a person shuffling along and simply doing their job.  Youre too young to understand this but the most difficult task mankind ever tried to master  and that we never quite managed  was how to pass supreme power from one hand to the next. ... Until now. We solved it here with the cryopods and the shifts. Power is temporary and it never leaves the same few hands. There is no transfer of power.  Their days were counted. The idea of saving anything was folly a life especially. No life had ever been truly saved not in the history of mankind. They were merely prolonged. Everything comes to an end.

As individuals grow frustrated with the burdens of owning caring for and storing too much stuff they are looking for ways to minimize that stress. They are also experiencing a need for meaningful connection and community.The membershipbased business is a problemsolver for both businesses and individuals. It spares people from the duties of ownership and provides a feeling of commonality and affiliation. For businesses it offers the opportunity to create a forever customer who remains loyal and participatory even as the company shifts and changes. Membership allows for building direct relationships and continuously generates a data stream that can be tapped for a variety of purposes.Ultimately it provides the cache of belonging.;272;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1417404992m22573915.jpg;The Membership Economy;nonfiction;A wellresearched look at how membership organizations have succeeded and how to replicate that success. There are plenty of examples and good summaries make it easy to digest. Its clear that Baxter has a lot of experience working with membership organizations. I felt I needed to work too hard to glean the lessons from the fairly long examples they couldve been distilled to save the reader time.  Baxter defines membership as being formally engaged with an organization or group on an ongoing basis. In a membership the organization builds relationships with members. Memberships may involve subscriptions community and communication but those things alone dont make a membership.  I read this because Im overhauling the WordPress website care plans (maintenance plans) offered by my web agency OptimWise and Im learning about improving subscription services. I much preferred The Automatic Customer to this book but maybe thats because that book is specifically about building a subscription business and this one has the broader scope of membership organizations.  What You Need to Know About the Membership Economy  A subscription is a financial arrangement a membership is a sense of belonging to a community and having the organization tailor its offerings to your preferences.  Benefits to organizations  1. Creates recurring revenue and removes lumpiness.  2. Builds a more direct relationship that strengthens the brand by putting customer at center.  3. Generates data that can be used to improve services.  Ideally members engage with each other so all benefit from the thoughts experiences opinions of others.  Membership Economy Strategies and Tactics  Replace customer support with customer success. Empower frontline staff to take good care of members. Be more consultative to build loyalty. Be personal build relationships. Goal is to maximize loyalty not just minimize anger.  Onboarding   Welcome make sure they know what they signed up for. Thank them for joining.   Engage immediately. Provide initial value. Use gamification to encourage behaviors. Connect with other community members.   Ask for feedback. Contact within first week.   Give feedback. Tell how they compare to other members. Point out new customers unique strengths.   Ask for referrals. Encourage to invite friends in the first 30 days.   Transition to nurturing. Give info to help optimize experience and connect. Communicate consistently.  Pricing  Most organizations have 3 pricing options based on research that most people prefer to have options and majority choose middle option.  Annual payment is best for many organizations because it locks in longer terms but this changes customers decision from impulse or low consideration to thoughtful considered decision. Once they rethink purchase they may cancel.  Offer a la carte services but dont put outoftheordinary onetime services into a higherlevel ongoing tier because customers may feel cheated for being forced into an ongoing commitment for a onetime need or may game the system by upgrading for just one month.  When raising prices grandfather current members to avoid backlash and build stickiness. Add higher tiers with more benefits. If you must raise prices on current members be transparent. You can also add and remove a la carte services.  Nearly every company benefits from offering options and different levels for different segments of members. Build options based on the objectives of segments.  Consider these levers in structuring tiers   Volume (content users account time interactions)   Duration (longer access)   Features (products tools)   Service (support customization implementation removal of annoyances such as ads)  Discounting should only be done to get people to try product long enough to commit to a full price or if alternative is losing customer.  Free  Dont offer a free trial that doesnt to provide the full experience. This gives an inaccurate and negative impression. If you fear customer will fill their need with free trial and not pay for full create a shortterm paid membership option.  Dont offer premium option when theres no interaction between users (such as accounting or security apps) since theres no potential for viral marketing or network effects.  How to Retain Members  When members help others get up to speed they become more loyal themselves (e.g. user groups).  To increase loyalty increase engagement   Periodically give something extra.   Allow them to connect to you personally.   Incorporate incremental setup to make switching cost seem high.   Connect members to each other to help each other.   Invite members to create content for community.   Use newsletters and messages to tell members how to get more value.   Ask members for ideas and advice.  Members are more reluctant to cancel when they achieve status have customized experience build relationships or have a grandfathered benefits or discounts.  Cancellation must be easy and clear or they will complain to you and anyone who will listen. Also people are more likely to sign up again if its easy to cancel.  Let canceling members have a free subscription of some kind  something that lets them remain part of the family.  Membership Organizations Come in All Shapes and Sizes  When it decided to raise prices SurveyMonkey kept annual subscription the same price (200) but raised monthly price by 20 motivating best customers to switch to annual. It also added 2 higherpriced tiers at 300 and 800. Some customers upgraded but majority of high tier users were new.  SaaS companies can share data (collected by systems or surveys) with customers or offer advice on making better decisions in certain verticals.  Try to keep subscriptions at same price. Difficult to raise a subscription price without adding benefits.  Many subscription organizations have found annual payments have a net positive effect on retention and revenues.  When first starting a subscription business start with a single offering because its less confusing and leaves room for adjusting price.;Robbie Kellman Baxter

Its also a bit too selfpromotional. I mostly agree with the fundamentals of Robbins approach (as far as I understand it as an amateur) index use a fiduciary pay attention to asset allocation etc.  Much of the advice is based on the work and teachings of John Bogle Burton Malkiel Warren Buffett Ray Dalio and David Swenson.  The last several chapters (sections 6 and 7) dont add much value and are much longer than necessary.  There are more concise and worthwhile books on personal finance and investing. Check out my Finance shelf.  I read this because it was recommended on Freelancers Show.  Notes  Mutual Funds  96 of active mutual funds fail to match or beat the market over any extended period of time (10 years). The 4 who beat the market are constantly changing.  Fiduciary  Use a Registered Investment Advisor whos a fiduciary. Their fees may be taxdeductible depending on your tax bracket.  Find a fiduciary at Stronghold Financial or findanadvisor.napfa.org  5 Criteria for Finding a Fiduciary  1. Registered with state or SEC as Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) or Investment Advisor Representative (IAR) of an RIA.  2. Compensated on percentage of assets under management (AUM) not for buying funds. Make sure this is the only fee and is completely transparent. Make sure there are no 12B1 fees or paytopay fees.  3. Not compensated for trading stocks or bonds.  4. Not affiliated with a broker dealer.  5. Money held with reputable thirdparty custodian (Fidelity Schwab TD Ameritrade etc.)  Retirement Plans  Put as much money into Roth accounts as possible as tax rates are likely to increase. Conventional wisdom says youll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement because youll be earning less but that may not be true since you wont have mortgage deductions if your house is paid off and you wont have dependents if you dont have kids at home.  If you make too much money for a Roth IRA use a Roth 401(k).  If youre a small business owner maxing out your plans consider a Cash Balance Plan (Pension) on top of your 401(k).  Target Date Funds  Target date funds assume that bonds are less risky than stocks which isnt always true. They also assume that bonds have inverse or low correlation to stocks which isnt always true they can be correlated during rough times.  For the average investor with simple needs a lowcost target date fund from Vanguard can be a decent choice.  Upside without the Downside   Structured notes. Get through fiduciary. Give you downside protection and percentage of upside. Best when close to or in retirement.   Marketlinked CDs. Small guaranteed return (coupon). If market falls you get back investment plus small return. FDICinsured. Get through fiduciary.   Fixed indexed annuities (FIA). 100 principal protection. Tax deferred.  House  Prepay mortgage principal each month to pay off 30year mortgage in 15 years. This saves the interest on each payment. Doing this over the life of your mortgage will decrease your total mortgage payments by half.  Dont count your house as an investment. House prices have risen by 0 over the last century after adjusting for inflation.  Dream Bucket  Set aside 5 to 10 for your dream bucket for enjoyment in short term.  Investment Portfolio  Rebalance once or twice a year. Pay attention to tax impact.  A 5050 stockbond portfolio isnt balanced because stocks are 3 times riskier than bonds. You must consider the risk factor not just how the dollars are allocated.  David Swensens Recommended Portfolio  20 domestic stock  20 international stock  10 emerging market stock  20 REITs  15 longterm US Treasuries  15 TIPS  Portfolio protects against inflation or deflation. Fairly aggressive. Outperformed SP 500 and more stable than it.  Ray Dalios All Seasons Portfolio  30 stocks (SP 500 or other indexes)  15 intermediate term government bonds (710 year Treasuries)  40 longterm government bonds (2025 year Treasuries)  7.5 gold  7.5 commodities  Portfolio isnt always taxefficient so hold it in taxsheltered accounts  Warren Buffetts Recommended Portfolio  10 shortterm government bonds  90 lowcost SP 500 index fund (Vanguards)  Annuities  Immediate annuities are best for those near or in retirement.  Deferred annuities   Fixed annuity fixed guaranteed return each year   Indexed annuity return is tied to stock market you get percentage of upside of market with no downside and no possibility of loss   Hybrid indexed annuity benefits of indexed annuity plus lifetime income rider  Get annuity from a highlyrated insurance company.  Avoid variable annuities.  Use a fixed indexed annuity (FIA) to get a guaranteed income for life. You must be 50 or older and have a large lump sum to open an account.  LifetimeIncome.com can help you find the right annuity even if youre young or dont have a lump sum to start with. Or work with fiduciary.

I read this because I wanted to understand more about the many references to Greek and Roman mythology that are woven into Western culture.  Reading this made me want to play Age of Mythology again.  Notes  Greek and Roman mythology   Silenus usually rode a donkey because he was too drunk to walk.   The Romans adopted the Greek gods because they didnt have their own definitely personified gods. Their gods were vague simply viewed as those that are above.   Fauns are the Roman equivalent of Greek satyrs.   Earth and Heaven were forces not living creatures. The first living creatures were the children of Mother Earth (Gaea) and Father Heaven (Ouranos).   The children of Earth and Heaven were 1) huge creatures with a hundred hands and fifty heads 2) the Cyclopes and 3) the Titans.   The Giants and Furies sprang up from the blood of the Titan Cronus. The Furies pursued and punished sinners.   After the gods crushed the Titans Earth gave birth to Typhon. Zeus destroyed it.   Epimetheus (Prometheus brother) gave the best gifts to the animals. Because no good was left for man Prometheus made them in the upright shape of the gods and gave them fire for protection.   Pandora was the first woman. From her ... comes the race of women who are an evil to men with a nature to do evil.   Hercules was simple and sometimes blunderingly stupid. He was quick to repent and desired to make amends. He was so confident in his strength that he even wrestled Death. He killed people quickly sometimes accidentally.   Rome was founded by descendants of Aeneas a Trojan who escaped Troy.  Norse mythology   The gods know that they and Asgard will one day be destroyed. The cause of good (gods and men) against evil is hopeless.   In the last battle of good against evil (Ragnarok) men will fight with the gods but will lost. The gods are doomed to destruction by the frost giants.   The Valkyries were maidens who brought the dead to Valhalla.   Loki wasnt a god but the son of a giant.   Man was created from an Ash tree and woman from an Elm.   Dwarfs were ugly but masterful craftsmen earth lived under the earth. Elves were lovely sprites who tended flowers and streams.   The Elder Edda tells of new eternal heaven and earth after defeat of gods and humans and destruction of present heaven and earth.;Edith Hamilton

Adams puts a lot of emphasis on age (how long ago Google first indexed the content) but Googles Matt Cutts has stated age isnt a significant factor.  Adams recommends setting up a subdomain at Blogger.com or WordPress.com in addition to your main domain and posting similar content to it to benefit from the authority of those domains. Ive heard that this isnt valuable because the authority of the domain (Blogger.com or WordPress.com) doesnt greatly benefit the subdomain (yoursite.wordpress.com) see for instance the Moz post How to Use Hosted Blog Platforms for SEO  Content Distribution.

Berkhof provides ample scriptural support for the Reformed positions. It briefly presents alternative views and identifies their strengths (if any) and weaknesses and evaluates them based on the Bible. The book is logically organized.  I was especially interested in these topics image of God covenant of works dispensations of covenant of grace in OT common grace and eschatology.  I read the free ebook from BiblicalTraining. You can also read it online. Heres the Table of Contents.  Predestination  Words for predestination mean more than simply foreknowledge they mean a selective knowledge which regards one with favor  love close to foreordination.  Gods elective love precedes the sending of His Son so predestination isnt determined by anything in man (John 316 Rom 58 1 John 49). Its unconditional (Acts 1348).  Its irresistible. This doesnt mean that man cant oppose it to a certain degree but means that opposition wont prevail. Also doesnt mean that God overpowers mans free agency but means that God makes the heart willing (Ps 113 Phil 213).  Reprobation is clearly taught as opposition of election (Rom 91322 117 Jude 4 Matt 112526 1 Pet 28).  Verses Acts 223 Rom 829 112 1 Pet 12 1 Cor 83 Gal 49 2 Tim 219 Rom 911 115 2 Thess 213 Acts 428 Rom 829 1 Cor 27 Eph 1411 2 Tim 19 Matt 2214 Rom 115 1 Cor 12728 1 Thess 14 2 Pet 110.  Creation of the Spiritual World  Cherubim reveal Gods power majesty glory  guard His holiness in Eden tabernacle temple  descent into earth.  Seraphim stand as servants around Gods throne sing His praises  do His bidding. They serve purpose of reconciliation preparing men to approach God.  Principalities powers thrones  dominions refer to differences of rank or dignity.  Gabriels special task was to mediate  interpret divine revelations.  Michael is called the archangel and is a prince  valiant warrior.  Bible doesnt speak of angels as guardians of individuals. Matt 1810 is too general to prove it but indicates theres a group of angels that care for little ones.  Creation of the Material World  Gen 2 begins history of man and repeats parts of Gen 1 creation account as necessary in nonchronological order.  Providence  God controls free actions of moral creatures (Gen 455 501920 Ex 101 20 2 Sam 161011 Isa 1057 Acts 223 42728). Sinful acts are under divine control  predetermined but only by divine permission not cause (Ex 1417 Isa 664 Rom 922 2 Thess 211). God often restrains sin (Gen 36 Job 112 26 Ps 7610 Isa 1015 Acts 751).  Constitutional Nature of Man  Body  spirit are the only 2 constitutional elements of man. Bible uses soul and spirit interchangeably. Man has spirit but is soul.  Man as the Image of God  Image  likeness are used interchangeably. Image of God includes original righteousness true knowledge righteousness holiness (Col 310 Eph 424). These lost by sin but regained in Christ. Image includes natural constitution of man intellect natural affections moral freedom. Even after Fall man has Image even reprobate (Gen 96 1 Cor 117 Jas 39). Spirituality is part of Image (Gen 27). Body is part of Image since man isnt complete without body  murder is called destruction of Image (Gen 96). Immortality is part of Image endowed by God (Gen 217 319 Rom 512 623 1 Cor 152021). Mans dominion over lower creation may be part of Image (Gen 126 Ps 856).  Man in the Covenant of Works  Doctrine of covenant of works was developed after Reformation though its elements are present in writings of Reformers  of early church fathers.  God created a legal compact with man. Elements 1) Adam was representative head of humanity 2) he was on probation 3) he was promised eternal life for himself  descendents if he obeyed. Last point is implied in death penalty. If Adam hadnt sinned humanity would have been raised above possibility of death. Promise of life would remove limitations of Adams life (Rom 710).  Principle of covenant the man that does these things shall live thereby (Lev 185 Ezek 201120 Luke 1028 Rom 105 Gal 312).  Condition implicit  perfect obedience. Command to not eat fruit was test of pure obedience.  Penalty death in most inclusive sense physical spiritual eternal separation from source of life. At Fall Adam  Eve entered spiritual death  death began to operate in body. Full execution of death sentence was arrested by Gods introduction of economy of grace  restoration.  Obligations of covenant of works were met by Christ. After Fall man could no longer use that covenant to obtain eternal life.  Nature of the Covenant of Grace  No conditions are meritorious. The sinner is told to repent and believe but these dont merit covenant blessings. Covenant is conditional on suretyship of Jesus He met conditions of covenant of works.  Covenant is conditioned on faith (John 316 36 Acts 837 Rom 109 43ff 20ff Gen 156 Hab 24 Gal 31428 Heb 11). Bible warns covenant children who refuse to walk in covenant. If there were no condition only God would be bound but man is bound (Ezek 2037)  a covenant requires 2 parties. God enables man to act as 2nd party. Man meets demands of faith  conversion only because God works in him.  Dual Aspect of the Covenant  In covenant of grace God promises benefits to man if man fulfils conditions. Condition of faith Gen 156 Rom 43ff Hab 24 Gal 31428 Heb 11. Promise of spiritual  eternal blessings Gen 177 123 Isa 4325 Ezek 3627 Rom 45ff Gal 314 18).  The Different Dispensations of the Covenant  There are 2 dispensationsadministrations OT  NT. OT is subdivided into several periodsstages in revelation of covenant of grace  1. Protevangel (Gen 315).  2. Covenant with Noah where God promised not to destroy all flesh with a flood  to maintain seasons. This conferred only natural blessings so it sometimes called covenant of nature or of common grace. This covenant includes all people until end of world.  3. Covenant with Abraham marks beginning of institutional Church. Prior to Abraham there was no visible mark separating Gods people. Spiritual blessings of covenant become far more apparent (Rom 3  4 Gal 3).  4. Sinaitic covenant was national covenant linked to civil life of Israel. External blessings were conditioned on keeping law (Deut 28114) (moral civil ceremonial).  Covenant of grace revealed in NT is essentially same as OT.  Common Grace  Common doesnt refer to grace being given to all men in common (general universal) but refers to producing effects which are ordinary and fall short of saving efficacy.  It can be called grace because God couldnt be good kind or benevolent to the sinner unless He were gracious.  Definitions 1) general operations of Spirit whereby he exercises a moral influence on man through general or special revelation restraining sin maintaining social order  promoting civil righteousness without renewing the heart. 2) general blessings such as rain sunshine food clothes shelter which God gives to all men indiscriminately.  Common grace  special grace are different in kind not degree. No amount of common grace leads to salvation.  Works of unregenerate can be good from a material view as works God commands but not good from a formal view since they dont have the right motive  purpose. Bible calls works of unregenerate good and right (2 Kings 102930 122 14327 Luke 633 Rom 21415).  Bible says God blesses reprobate (Gen 395 Matt 54445 Luke 63536 Rom 24).  Bible uses grace in ways besides saving grace Gen 68 1919 Ex 3312 16 Num 325 Luke 240).  God has a favorable disposition towards all men that falls short of granting salvation (Prov 124 Isa 118 Ezek 1823 32 3311 Matt 54345 2337 Mark 1021 Luke 635 Rom 24 1 Tim 24).  Perseverance of the Saints  Verses John 102729 Rom 1129 83839 Phil 16 2 Thess 33 2 Tim 112 418.  Christian Baptism  No explicit command to baptize children and no plain recording of baptism of children but there are biblical grounds.  Children had an integral role in covenant in OT and received sign and seal of covenant and we wouldnt expect privileges to be reduced in NT (Isa 5413 Jer 3134 Joel 228 Matt 1914 Acts 239).  Baptism replaces circumcision (Matt 281920 Mark 161516 Col 21112).  NT speaks of baptism of households as if its ordinary (Acts 1615 33 1 Cor 116). Its unlikely that none of these households contained children.  Lords Supper  Jesus used unleavened bread and ordinary wine but neither are stressed so its permissible to use leavened bread and another kind of wine.  Immortality of the Soul  OT sheol is represented as state of conscious existence but not of bliss. Man enters bliss by deliverance from sheol. Ps 1610 4914 15.  Intermediate State  Sheol and hades dont always denote a locality but often refer to state of death (or power of death or danger of death). In this way believers and unbelievers are said to be in sheol or hades.  When sheol or hades designate a literal locality they refer to Hell or grave. Descent into sheol is threatened as punishment for wicked (Ps 917 4914 5515 Prov 1511 1524 Luke 1623. Sheol isnt abode of believers (Prov 55 1511 2720).  In OT sheol is used more often for grave and less often for Hell in NT hades is used more often for Hell and less often for grave.  Second Coming of Christ  Jesus mentions great tribulation as a sign of His coming and of end of world (Matt 243). He is speaking of 2nd coming (parousia) throughout Matt 24 and says in v. 2930 that His coming will be immediately after great tribulation. Tribulation will also affect elect (Matt 242224 Luke 2128). Great falling away will precede 2nd coming (2 Thess 23) and grievous times will come in last days (1 Tim 412 2 Tim 315). Rev 71314 says saints in Heaven came out of great tribulation and Rev 69 says saints pray for those still suffering persecution. 1 Thess 234 says day of Christ cant come until after the falling away and man of sin (son of perdition) which reminds of Dan 1136ff and speaks of Antichrist.  What we know about Antichrist AntiChristian principle was already at work in days of Paul and John. It will reach its highest power towards end of world. Daniel pictures the political Paul the ecclesiastical and John (in Revelation) both sides these may be successive revelations of antiChristian power. This power will probably finally be concentrated in a single individual.  Antichrist denotes a person in last days the incarnation of wickedness who represents spirit of antichrist that has always been present and there are several precursors of that final person of Antichrist. This view prevailed in early church. Dan 11 may refer to a definite person. Pauls descriptions of Antichrist seem to refer to a person. John speaks of many antichrists already present but also of Antichrist in the singular as one still coming (1 John 218). Descriptions in Rev contain personal elements (Rev 1920). Since Christ is a person its natural to think Antichrist will be.  Millennial Views  Name Amillennialism is new but view is as old as Christianity. It had at least as many advocates as Chiliasm among church fathers of 2nd  3rd centuries. It has ever been the most widely accepted view. Its the only view expressed or implied in great historical confessions. Its always been prevalent view in Reformed circles.  Bible teaches of great apostasy tribulation persecution in time immediately preceding the end (Matt 24622 Luke 188 212528 2 Thess 2312 2 Tim 316 Rev 13). Postmillennialists try to minimize this and expect a glorious condition of the Church in the end based on passages which contain figurative descriptions of the entire gospel dispensation or of the eternal Kingdom.  The Final Judgment  There will be different degrees both of bliss of Heaven and punishment of Hell determined by whats done during life (Matt 112224 Luke 124748 2047 Dan 123 2 Cor 96).  The Final State  Other terms for Hell prison (1 Pet 319) abyss (Luke 831) tartarus (2 Pet 24).  Our good works will be the measure of our gracious reward though they do not merit it. Notwithstanding this however the joy of each individual will be perfect and full.;Louis Berkhof
1213;26401901;5;50548;;George Orwell depicts a gray totalitarian world dominated by Big Brother and its vast network of agents including the Thought Police a world in which news is manufactured according to the authorities will and people live tepid lives by rote.Winston Smith the hero with no heroic qualities longs only for truth and decency. But living in a social system in which privacy does not exist and where those with unorthodox ideas are brainwashed or put to death he knows there is no hope for him. He knows even as he continues to pursue his forbidden love affair that eventually he will come to destruction.The year 1984 has come and gone yet George Orwells nightmare vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is still the great modern classic of negative Utopia. It is a prophetic and haunting tale that exposes the worst crimes imaginable the destruction of freedom and truth.;0;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1442082925m26401901.jpg;1984;fiction;This classics messages about politics society and economics are deeply thoughtprovoking.  It was interesting to read the excerpts from Goldsteins Book (The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism) and to see how the philosophies of the Party and the Brotherhood played out in reality.  The unexpected and depressing ending strengthens the storys warning.  Themes   Unknown history   Lack of individuality   Government oversight and control   Suppression of independent thought   Denial of freedom  At the time the book was written 1984 was the future. In this future England has become part of the multinational Oceania. The Party rules over the proles (proletariet working class) and keeps an allseeing eye over Party members. They are constantly reminded of this surveillance by posters proclaiming that Big Brother is watching.  Not only does the Party watch people but the Thought Police monitor facial expressions and other nonverbal communication to detect thoughtcrime any thinking that isnt explicitly for the good of the Party. To survive one must master doublethink the ability to know and believe two contradictory things. Individual thoughts actions and sexuality are forbidden. The language Newspeak is composed of a limited vocabulary that limits thoughts and expressions.  The book follows Winston Smith as he seeks out The Brotherhood an underground society working to overthrow the Partys rule.  The SparkNotes are very good.  Favorite Quotes   He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past.   If you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human facefor ever.   But if thought corrupts language language can also corrupt thought.   Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one.   Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.    Sanity is not statistical.  This book and Animal Farm are Orwells most famous books. Both are dystopian tales of the dangers of a totalitarian government.  Similarities between the books   The government knows best.   The intelligentsia seize power.   The naive proletariat are oppressed and kept ignorant.   The government bends or breaks its own rules for its benefit.   The government uses propaganda to keep the proletariat in check.   The government rewrites history to prove that its correct and that life is better with the government than it was before the governments rise to power.   Both books have pessimistic endings.;George Orwell Simon Prebble

There are more elements of horror (chase scenes gore etc.). I liked reading of the Towns early years and seeing characters in their youth. This book answers many questions raised in the previous books but leaves a few unresolved.  Part of me felt the ending was a cheap copout to avoid resolving a story I was so invested in. But another part of me realized the plot device is very similar to XMen Days of Future Past (and other stories with alternate timeline endings) which I didnt mind. If I had really loved the first two books I may have felt more strongly about the ending.  My main complaint about this book and the trilogy is that Christians are portrayed as either deceitful manipulative charlatans or ignorant irrational hypocrites. A couple times its implied that the Christianity in the story is corrupt but the vast majority of the time this negative light shines on all Christianity and even all religion without the footnote that this is an instance of religion corrupted. Im glad that FatherBrother Tyler is there as a positive Christian character. And I was glad to readKatie would have liked to blame religion itself but even she could not deceive herself that fully. A church was only as good or bad as the philosophy that emanated from the pulpit.Still Christianity and religion are portrayed as at best harmless delusions theres no room for God to truly exist.;Erika Johansen

Notes  The waters which were above the firmament (Gen 17) were most likely a spherical band of waters surrounding Earths atmosphere such as a blanket of water vapor in the ionosphere. The hydrological cycle wasnt functioning the same way then (Gen 256).  The waters above ended with the Flood (2 Pet 356). We observe no waters above now and todays atmosphere doesnt hold enough water to rain 40 days and nights.  The waters above may have been responsible for allowing Earth to support the incredible biomass that became coal and other fossil fuels for the large plant and animals that existed (e.g. dinosaurs) and for the long human lifespans before the Flood.;Henry M.

Its not about getting less done. Its about getting only the right things done. Its about challenging the core assumption of we can have it all and I have to do everything and replacing it with the pursuit of the right thing in the right way at the right time. Its about regaining control of our own choices about where to spend our time and energies instead of giving others implicit permission to choose for us.In Essentialism Greg McKeown CEO of a Leadership and Strategy agency in Silicon Valley who has taught at Apple Google and Facebook draws on experience and insight from working with the leaders of the most innovative companies and organizations in the world to show how to achieve what he calls the disciplined pursuit of less.

Its not about asking What do I have to give up its about asking What do I want to go big on It applies to all of life including work and personal life.  I read this because I have a lot of demands on my time being founder of a web design company father and involved in church and other organizations. In the past couple years Ive gotten better at focusing on what will actually make a difference and at exercising the power of saying no. This book motivated me to be even more disciplined.  I also recommend The 8020 Principle The Secret to Achieving More with Less.  Method  1. Explore. Discern the trivial many from the vital few. Commit and go big on only a few items. Ask 3 questions   What do I feel deeply inspired by   What am I particularly talented at   What meets a significant need in the world  2. Eliminate. Cut out the trivial many. Say no to social expectations.  3. Execute. Create a system for removing obstacles to execution.  Protect the Asset Yourself  Our highest priority is to protect our ability to prioritize. This means reducing stress getting enough sleep and generally ensuring our mental health.  Selection   Wait for the best rather than settling for good enough.   90 Rule as you evaluate an option think of the single most important criterion and rate the option from 0 to 100. If you rate it any lower than 90 change it to 0 and reject. This prevents indecision and settling.   Accept only the top 10 of opportunities. Take only those that are exactly what youre looking for.   If it isnt a clear yes then its a clear no.  Elimination   When evaluating an opportunity you have ask If I didnt already have this opportunity what would I be willing to do to acquire it If you wouldnt do much to acquire it eliminate it.   Run a reverse pilot quietly eliminate (or at least scale back) an effort and see if it makes any difference. If it doesnt eliminate it.;Greg McKeown

Part 1 PreSuasion The Frontloading of Attention  PreSuasion An Introduction  Highestachieving salespeople and marketers spend more time crafting what they say and do before making request. Before introducing message they make audience sympathetic to it.  To reduce price resistance before you give your fee joke As you can tell Im not going to be able to charge you X dollars for this where X is an unrealistically high amount (say 10x actual fee).  Privileged Moments  To change someones behavior alter whats prominent in their mind at the decision moment. E.g. ask Do you consider yourself helpful or Do you consider yourself adventurous liking to try new things  People believe what they pay attention to (or ignore) reflects what they value at that time. To make something seem more important make them focus on it.  Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.  Website visitors who saw the site with a background of clouds became inclined towards soft comfortable furniture. Those who saw the site with a background of pennies became inclined towards inexpensive furniture.  When you ask people to evaluate your products or services they focus on the product or service or your company and think more favorably of them.  Whats Focal is Causal  People automatically view whats focal as causal. E.g. leaders are given more credit or blame than they deserve simply because theyre in spotlight.  The more prominent and attentiongrabbing scare tactics are the better they work. To make them more effective add to the chilling message clear info about available steps that can be taken to avoid problem.  Make something appear distinctive from competing options to attract attention which makes that distinguishing factor seems more important and alluring.  Commanders of Attention 2 The Magnetizers  Start your message with selfrelevant cues (such as word you persons age sex etc.)  Telling a mystery story keeps audience focused on issues and makes them want to pay attention so they can solve the mystery.  Structure of mystery story  1. Pose mystery.  2. Deepen mystery.  3. Home in on proper explanation by considering (and offering evidence against) alternative explanation.  4. Provide clue to proper explanation.  5. Resolve mystery.  6. Draw implication for phenomenon under study.  Counterarguments are typically more powerful than arguments especially when counterclaim shows the rival to be a generally untrustworthy source of info in addition to being wrong in this particular instance.  Part 2 Processes The Role of Association  The Primacy of Associations I Link Therefore I Think  Words and images that connote achievement increase worker performance on an assigned task and more than double willingness to keep at it.  Metaphors are powerful. Example if crime is described as a raging beast people are more likely to recommend catchandcage solutions. If crime is described as a virus people are more likely to recommend solutions that remove unhealthy conditions.  People holding a heavy object perceive related items as serious important or requiring effort. People holding a warm object feel warmer toward closer to more trusting of those around them.  Avoid negative connotations. Replace used with preowned cost or price with purchase or investment.  People give more attention and importance to anything selfconnected. E.g. people with same birthday birthplace first name language products with names that share letters of alphabet with their names.  When people grasp something fluently (picture or process it quickly and effortlessly) they like it more and think its more valid and worthwhile. E.g. poetry with rhyme and regular meter is perceived as more favorable and aesthetic persuasive.  People have a greater liking for those with easily recognizable facial features and easily pronounced names (regardless of foreignness of name).  Difficulttoread claims are seen as less true.  Persuasive Geographies All the Right Places All the Right Traces  To produce work more suited to your target audience work while surrounded by people or objects that remind you of them or with photos of those people.  The elderly feel happier than when they were younger stronger healthier because they concentrate on positive thoughts and go to places that lift their moods (positive memories pleasant thought favorable info happy faces upsides of products). Elderly with best moods are those with greatest ability to pay attention because they can focus on those previously listed items.  Increase personal happiness  1. Write your blessingsgratitude at beginning of each day.  2. Look on bright side of situations events future possibilities. Be optimistic.  3. Limit time spent on problems or unhealthy comparisons with others.  The Mechanics of PreSuasion Causes Constraints and Correctives  To prompt an action find a concept already associated strongly and positively with that action and bring that concept to mind in audience just before requesting the action. E.g. bring up concept of togetherness just before asking for help.  Part 3 Best Practices The Optimization of PreSuasion  Six Main Roads to Change Broad Boulevards as Smart Shortcuts  To increase return on using rule of reciprocation what you give before asking should be meaningful unexpected customized.  To be more likable be friendly attractive humorous. Highlight similarities and give compliments. Show people you genuinely like them. People dont care how much you know until they know how much you care.  People view popular choices as more right morally and practically. Label products most popular to increase sales.  Telling people that their peers are doing the thing you want them to do is more effective than appealing to self interest.  Admit a weakness early on to gain instant trustworthiness. Channel the weakness onto a strength. E.g. Our setup costs arent the lowest but youll recoup them quickly due to our superior efficiency. This works best when strength doesnt just add something positive but instead challenges relevance of weakness.  Any constraint on access (number of items period of time etc.) increases the worth of whats offered.  People want to be consistent so get them to commit to something before they need to do it or remind them of their previous commitment.  When to use influence principles  Stage 1 (cultivating a positive association) use Reciprocity and Liking. Give first (in a meaningful unexpected customized way) highlighting genuine commonalities offering true compliments.  Stage 2 (reducing uncertainty) use Social Proof and Authority. Give evidence that choice is wellregarded by peers or experts.  Stage 3 (motivating action) use Consistency and Scarcity. Remind what they said about topic in past and what they could lose.  Unity 1 Being Together  7th principle of influence Relationships. They not only intensify willingness to help but also cause it.  Most influential relationships are those that allow people to say that person is of us not just that person is like us. Its about shared identities (race ethnicity nationality family politics religion).  Being of same family (bloodline) is ultimate relationship.  You can use power of family even with those not genetically connected by using familial language and imagery (brotherhood sisterhood forefathers motherland heritage etc.) You can also say youll treat them as family.  The medium can be the message the multitude can be the message (via social proof) the messenger can be the message (via authority) the merger (of self and other via relationships) can be the message.  Being of same place forms strong relationship. This applies at levels of homedomicile locality region.  To help your kids develop a broadly charitable nature give them contact in your home to people from a wide spectrum of backgrounds and treat them like family.  Unity 2 Acting Together  When people act in united ways they become united. Acting together in motoric vocal sensory ways can be a substitute for being together in kinship.  If buyer is shopping based on how product will affect them emotionally use feelingrelated arguments and say I feel .... If buyer is shopping based on logic and reason use logical arguments and say I think....  People feel a special affinity for things they have a hand in creating. The more involved they are the higher they rate its quality.  Companies can get consumers to feel more loyal by inviting current and prospective customers to cocreate new or updated products and services mostly by giving info on desirable features. Call it advice not opinions or expectations.  When you ask someone for advice they feel a sense of partnership with you and responsibility.  PostSuasion Aftereffects  Persuasive openers can produce dramatic immediate shifts in people but to turn these shifts into lasting changes get people to commit to them (in active effortful voluntary way). Ideally get them to behave consistently with the change. Incorporate behaviors that affect their personal identity.;Robert B. Cialdini

1222;32791494;2;50548;1328791823;The tale of Beren and Luthien was or became an essential element in the evolution of The Silmarillion the myths and legends of the First Age of the World conceived by J.R.R. Tolkien. Returning from France and the battle of the Somme at the end of 1916 he wrote the tale in the following year.Essential to the story and never changed is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Luthien for Beren was a mortal man but Luthien was an immortal elf. Her father a great elvish lord in deep opposition to Beren imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Luthien. This is the kernel of the legend and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Luthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings Melkor called Morgoth the Black Enemy of a Silmaril.In this book Christopher Tolkien has attempted to extract the story of Beren and Luthien from the comprehensive work in which it was embedded but that story was itself changing as it developed new associations within the larger history. To show something of the process whereby this legend of Middleearth evolved over the years he has told the story in his fathers own words by giving first its original form and then passages in prose and verse from later texts that illustrate the narrative as it changed. Presented together for the first time they reveal aspects of the story both in event and in narrative immediacy that were afterwards lost.Published on the tenth anniversary of the last Middleearth book the international bestseller The Children of Hurin this new volume will similarly include drawings and color plates by Alan Lee who also illustrated The Lord of the Ringsand The Hobbitand went on to win Academy Awards for his work onThe Lord of the Ringsfilm trilogy.;288;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1497828200m32791494.jpg;Beren and Lúthien;fantasy paranormal;This book shows how the story of Beren and Luthien transformed over 20 years. Its a collection of fragmented prose and verse some longer some shorter. I read most of the prose but skimmed the poems. The story of Beren and Luthien has never been one of my favorite of Tolkiens tales and this book didnt change that. I only recommend it to diehard Tolkien fans. Ill stick with the Silmarillion version of the story.  Notes  Tolkien called story of Beren and Luthien the chief of the stories of the Silmarillion.  Tolkiens original story had Beren as a Man later Tolkien changed him to be an Elf then later back to a Man.  Tolkien called High Elves Gnomes for knowledge before changing to Noldor.  An early version of the story explains enmity between cats and dogs. In it cats are large powerful servants of Melko (MelkorMorgoth) but were cursed and banished and became what they are today. Tevildo Prince of Cats faces off with Huan the hound.  Tevildo was replaced in later versions by Thu who became Sauron Lord of Wolves.  Tolkien wrote in 1964 I offered [publisher Allen  Unwin] the legends of the Elder Days but their readers turned that down. They wanted a sequel [to the Hobbit]. But I wanted heroic legends and high romance. The result was The Lord of the Rings.;J.R.R. Tolkien Christopher Tolkien Alan Lee
1223;33144844;4;50548;5712170;no description;0;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1480371531m33144844.jpg;The Millennium;nonfiction;Deep exposition of eschatology. Walks through 3 major views (Postmillennialism Postmillennialism Premillennialism). It opened my eyes to different interpretations. Author goes to the Bible to see what it really says rather than what human interpretations say. I especially liked the exploration of the Great Tribulation.  The author believes and makes a pretty convincing case for Postmil. He seems to fairly present the other views before explaining why theyre wrong. He spends most of book promoting Postmil view and tearing apart Premil view (especially Dispensationalism) doesnt spend much time spent on Amil view.  The author calls Amillennialism a comparatively mild departure from that system [taught in Scripture] acknowledging the spiritual nature of the Kingdom ... but failing to do justice to the glorious future that God has in store for this Kingdom specifically worldwide salvation.  The author says of Premillennialism that the principle of literal interpretation which characterizes all types of Premillennialism leads to serious error.  I was raised Amil and am most familiar with that view I wasnt very familiar with the other views until this book. After reading it I can understand how the Postmil view could arise from the Bible but not the Premil view.  Representative Theologians in the Different Systems  Postmil Augustine Hodges (Charles Archibald A. Caspar Wistar Hodge Jr.) B.B. Warfield Origen Jerome Jonathan Edwards  Premil was unpopular between Augustine and Reformation. During Reformation and for long time after held by only a few small sects considered heretical. John N. Darby C.I. Scofield  Amil as a system not clearly developed until recently. Louis Berkhof Geerhardus Vos Abraham Kuyper  Postmillennialism  Statement of the Doctrine  Kingdom of God is now being extended in world through preaching of the Gospel and saving work of Holy Spirit. World is eventually to be Christianized. Christ will return after a long period of righteousness and peace (Millennium). Then will be general resurrection general judgment and introduction of heaven and hell in their fullness.  Not every person on earth will be Christian but all forms of evil will be reduced to negligible proportions and Christian principles will be rule.  Vastness of the Redeemed Multitude  Rev. 191121 uses figurative language to describe spiritual conflict between good and evil with eventual victory of good. This doesnt describe literal fighting it describes conquest of Gospel. This is Romans 11 and 1 Cor 15 in symbolic form.  Bible uses contrast to show that the saved will far outnumber the lost (Luke 2035 Rev 211 Matt 53 Heb 1116 1 Pet 319 Rev 1920 21816 Luke 213 Is 63 Rev 511 201115).  Verses that make it sound like many more are lost than saved (Matt 714 2214) are meant to be understood in a temporal sense describing condition of Palestine in Jesus time. To read these as indicating numbers would be like inferring numbers from parables of Ten Virgins (Matt 25) or Lost Sheep.  World is Growing Better  Binding of Satan (Rev 2013) isnt sudden event but a long slow process from Christs death until present. It means Satan can no longer bind the nations so world can be Christianized.  Material Prosperity During the Millennium  There will be material prosperity during the Millennium result of high moral and spiritual life. Temporal blessings are prophesied in Is 351 Ps 72 Is 6520.  Christianity is to be controlling and transforming influence not only of moral life of some but also entire social economic and cultural life of nations.  In Millennium wolf and lamb will lie down together figuratively meaning that things formerly antagonistic and hateful will work together. Desert will blossom literally as economic and scientific conditions lead to development of natural resources and prosperous conditions and figuratively in moral improvement. Poverty and ignorance will be largely eliminated health and education will be general rule and wealth will be vastly more abundant and more widely distributed. Millennium will not involve a change in nature of Christianity just a much wider extension.  Millennial Age Approaches by Imperceptible Degrees  The Millennium wont start suddenly or on a particular date. Its result of long slow process.  We live in early dawn of Millennium.  Thousand Years a Symbolic Figure  The thousand years isnt an exact measure but a symbolical number. Its probably not less than 1000 years and probably much longer.  A Final Apostasy or Rebellion  Rev 2046 are parenthetical and refer to intermediate state.  God may permit limited manifestation of evil just before end (Rev 19) to show people that Devil and followers really are as bad as theyre said to be and as deserving of punishment. Thus Devil is given degree of freedom to gain some followers and make last attempt to destroy Kingdom.  Final war (Rev 191121) is the last phase of the spiritual war raging since Eden. No saints die. War against saints (Rev 20710) is of same nature but shorter  Fire coming out of heaven (Rev 209) refers to Christs final coming at close of Millennium.  Warfield didnt believe in resurgence of evil at end. He understood Rev 20110 to refer to intermediate state and thousand years to refer to Paradise.  Principles of Interpretation  To literalize prophesies of second coming is to make same mistake Jews made in literalizing Messianic prophecies (seeking an earthly kingdom and political ruler).  That literalistic interpretation cant be right can be proved simply by extinction of nations referred to in Rev 18.  Paul spiritualized entire OT economy in Gal 329. Peter spiritualized OT and buried Jewish eschatology in 1 Pet 25.  Nature and Purpose of Prophecy  Primary purpose of prophecy is to inspire faith in those who see its fulfillment secondary purpose is to inform of future. Its purpose is to accredit a messagemessenger (John 1429 1319).  Christs advent character ministry sufferings death and glorification are predicted in OT in such a way that no one prior to fulfillment could read prophecies clearly. In same way we cant read end times prophecies clearly.  Tribulation  Bible never uses word tribulation to refer to period at end of age. It always refers to 1) suffering of Christians in this age (most common) 2) suffering inflicted on rejectors of Christ 3) suffering prophesied for Jews in past history.  Great tribulation refers to entire Church Age.  Daniels 70 weeks prophecy to be fulfilled during Christs public ministry including abolition of Old Covenant then breakup of Jewish economy with destruction of temple and Jerusalem in 70 AD.  Luke 232830 Matt 24134 Luke 212036 refer to destruction of Jerusalem. Hes speaking to that generation (Matt 2434 Luke 2132). Jesus uses word generation to describe His contemporaries.  Jesus said greatest tribulation of all time was to occur at siege of Jerusalem. He wouldnt have said no nor ever shall be (Matt 2421) if He was talking about end of age.  Matt 2420 refers to winter and sabbath indicating a local not worldwide event.  Matt 2414 uses language similar to description of Pentecost (Acts 25 1620 Rom 18 1626 123) so neednt refer to end of world.  End in Matt 2414 refers to end of OT economy.  Abomination of desolation (Matt 241516) refers to Roman invasion of Palestine (foreign pagan army on sacred soil) see Luke 212021.  There were many false prophets and false Christs during siege of Jerusalem.  During siege there was famine and inflated prices of wheat and barley.  Eagles in Matt 2824 refer to Roman symbol carried by army. Christians took the invasion as the appointed sign and fled to Pella.  Gospels written before Jerusalems destruction (Matthew Mark Luke) contain prophecies of Great Tribulation Gospel of John was written after destruction and doesnt mention Tribulation.  Pauls references to some falling away (1 Tim 41) and grievous times (2 Tim 31) applied primarily to his day seen from his advice to Timothy (1 Tim 46 2 Tim 35).  Antichrist  In verses that mention Antichrist (1 John 218 222 43 2 John 7) word is applied to many persons existing in 1st century. Mark of an antichrist is denial of Christs deity. 1 John 46 shows that spirit of antichrist isnt necessarily a person.  No reference in Daniel Ezekiel Paul or Revelation is connected with verses in Johns epistles that mention antichrist connection is only inferred. View of Amil and some Postmil that Antichrist will be political or religious leader shortly before Christs coming is also built on inference.  Man of Sin was a Roman emperor or line of emperors at that time. Nero persecuted Vespasian was called miracleworker Titus put his idolatrous insignia in Holy of Holies. 2 Thess 24 says Man of Sin opposes all that is called God or worshipped so he cant be a religious figure. That he sits in the temple means that this must have been fulfilled before temples fall in 70 AD. Destruction of lawless one in 2 Thess 28 refers to Christs coming in judgment on Roman emperors language is similar to Gods judgment in Is 191 Micah 13.  Apostasy of 2 Thess 23 was Jewish apostasy that climaxed at destruction of Jerusalem.  Coming of Christ  OT and NT refer to the coming of God or Christ for various things including coming of Christ at death.  Matt 242930 means Son of man (not sign) is in heaven it refers to Pentecost a visible sign of Christs being in heaven. Mark 146162 has a similar declaration this event was to occur within lifetime of that Sanhedrin so refers to Christs coming at Jerusalems destruction. Coming with clouds is an OT expression for coming in judgment (Is 1914 Ps 1043 Is 13910 Is 3445 Micah 135). Darkening of sun etc. means sun of Judaism has been darkened as the moon it no longer reflects the Light of God bright stars as were the prophets no longer shine in Israel.  In Matt 2431 angels is better translated messengers meaning ministers sent to preach Gospel and gather elect from entire earth.  Matt 2618 speaks of coming within disciples lifetime so refers to His coming to them after His resurrection.  NT never speaks of Christs return as second coming He comes in various ways and at all times.  NT teaches Christs return is absolutely certain not imminent.  DateSetting  When Christ said He comes quickly (Rev 2220) He didnt mean coming soon He referred to 1) sudden coming without warning or 2) coming for His people at their death.  The Last Days The Latter Days  NT refers to entire Christian era as end of the times (1 Pet 120) last days (Acts 217 2 Tim 31 James 53 2 Pet 33) last time (Jude 18) last hour (1 John 218). These close this world or this age. There may be a very last of the last last day (John 640 1124) or last time (1 Pet 15).  Amillennialism  Dominant Reformed view. Most if not all Reformers were amil following Augustine. Augustines teachings had elements of postmil and amil so hes claimed by both views.  View has been most fully developed by Abraham Kuyper Herman Bavinck other Dutch. On European continent its standard Reformed and Lutheran theology. Major American theologians of later 19th and early 20th century were postmil.  Amil proponents have different and sometimes conflicting views. Some say Millennium means part or all of church age. Others say its intermediate state.  By not having a Christianized world amil leaves many prophecies unexplained. These prophecies must be fulfilled before Christs return.  Premillennialism  Main difference between Historic Premillennialism and Dispensationalism Historic Premil says Church goes through Tribulation before Rapture Dispensationalism says Rapture occurs before Tribulation and Christ may come any time without warning signs.  Historic Premil says there will be recognizable signs before Christs coming including Antichrist and Tribulation. Dispensationalism says all prophecies of events prior to Christs coming have been fulfilled.  No great creeds state premil doctrine all imply postmil or amil.;Loraine Boettner

Notes  Now ask Where is the Force of Others and one answer becomes inevitable the kind and cold moon of Jedha.  I ask you to believe that Jedha is a nexus for faith life and the Force of Others in all their forms. If the Force can be embodied in a vision or a living creature why not a place  Do you not wonder why the Guardians of the Whills protect their temple so Why the Jedi carry their cruel swords of light even here It is because our pilgrimages are in accordance with our faiths and faith can bring terrible conflict.  Death Stars sensors were temporarily blinded by dust storm after destruction of Jedha and couldnt detect ships leaving.  The Empire had to retroactively install ventilation shafts into Death Star to vent core radiation.  Clone facilities on Kamino were shut down after Clone Wars.  When Bail Organa mentions contacting his Jedi friend Mon Mothma thinks of a Jedi coming out of hiding to fight the Empire.  Mon Mothma has reservations about the agent Organa will send to contact his Jedi friend. Mothma thinks that shes so young among other things.  Chirrut Imwe was last Guardian of the Whills.  Tarkin blew up citadel on Scarif to prevent Rebels from escaping with or transmitting Death Star plans. He didnt like Scarif because Imperial officers had used it as a place to unofficially retire.;Alexander Freed

It covers Presbyterians and Reformed in France Geneva (Switzerland) Netherlands Scotland England and US up to 1951. Despite the title its much more about history than beliefs only the first and last of the 12 chapters are primarily about beliefs. The rest are primarily about history and beliefs are briefly mentioned where they come into the history. I found this very helpful in understanding Presbyterian church history.  Notes  Presbyterianism in the Bible  Biblical basis for Presbyterianism Acts 1423 2017 Titus 15 Ex 316 Num 1116.  2 kinds of elders teaching (ministers) and ruling shown by 1 Tim 517.  NT elders were elected. Acts 12326 63 1423.  Presbyterianism has elders elected by people (representative government) (Presbyterian Reformed). Episcopalianism has government by bishops (Roman Catholic Episcopal Methodist). Congregationalism has government directly by people (Congregational Baptist).  Principle of church courts binding congregations together comes from Antioch Council of Acts 15 1 Tim 414.  John Calvin and Presbyterianism  In 1550s large majority of Catholics and Protestants approved of death penalty for heresy and blasphemy. Michael Servetus had been sentenced to burn by Catholics before he escaped to Geneva. Geneva City Council tried him and Calvin was a witness against him. Council sentenced him to burn but Calvin urged a more humane execution. Council refused and burned Servetus.  Presbyterianism in Scotland  Presbyterian Church in Scotland founded by John Knox is mother church of several branches of the Presbyterian Church in US and of Presbyterian Church in Ireland Canada Australasia South Africa and many mission nations.  The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America  Presbyterians had a large share in movement that led up to American Declaration of Independence large part in Revolutionary War and large influence on US Constitution.  In 1789 Presbyterians were most influential denomination in US. Nearly all had been for independence. 23 of US population had Presbyterian or Calvinistic background.  In 1801 Presbyterian and Congregational Churches entered a union which allowed each others ministers to pastor their churches. By 1830s questions Presbyterians raised questions about theological soundness of Congregational ministers. In 1837 church split along theological lines into New School and Old School.  In 1857 New School split into north and south over slavery. In 1861 Old School did same. In 1870 north Old and South Schools reunited into PCUSA.  OPC split off PCUSA in 1936 over doctrinal controversies about inspiration virgin birth Christs resurrection.;Walter Lee Lingle
1232;34971456;1;50548;;There is a large demand for a textbook on the history and doctrines of the Presbyterian Church to be used in the Sunday Schools Pastors study classes and the study classes of Young Peoples and Womens Societies. In casting about for such a book the Presbyterian Committee of Publication found ready at home that charming little book The Creed of Presbyterians by the Rev. Egbert Watson Smith D. D. Executive Secretary of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the United States. It is worthy of note that this book has already had a far larger circulation than any other book ever written in America on Presbyterianism. However The Creed of Presbyterians is written in popular style for the general reader and was not primarily intended for a textbook but the Committee of Publication hit upon a happy idea and that was to convert it into a textbook by dividing it into lessons and adding a list of questions to be used in connection with each lesson. So we have in this new edition a book which has all the charm of the original edition and which can be read without any thought of the classroom but at the same time a book which can be instantly converted into a textbook by turning to the lesson divisions and questions in the back. With this new adjustment we believe that The Creed of Presbyterians will meet in an admirable way the demand for a textbook on the history and doctrines of the Presbyterian Church. Practically every question on each lesson can be answered by a careful study of the pages assigned to that lesson and it is not necessary for members of the class to have any other book in connection with the course. But it will be found helpful to make frequent reference toencyclopedia articles and to such histories as members of the class may have. It will also be found helpful to have at hand an exceedingly interesting and informing book entitled The Burning Bush A Story of the Presbyterian Church by J. R. Fleming. With these suggestions we send The Creed of Presbyterians out upon its new mission as a textbook with the sincere hope and conviction that it will fill a long felt need. The questions were prepared by Rev. W. L. Lingle D. D. of Union Theological Seminary Moderator of the General Assembly of 1920.

The main idea is that in a subscription business the role of marketing expands to encompass the entire business. After the sale marketing must nurture value and sustain trust. It includes many techniques and examples.  I read this because Im currently working on revamping the subscription WordPress maintenance plans at OptimWise my web agency.  Notes  The Subscription Shift  Avg. annualized churn rate for B2B is 24 B2C is 31.  Marketers in subscription biz must be focused on churnretention. Marketing campaigns and customer success efforts can reduce churn.  In a subscription biz everyones in marketing. Those in Marketing roles must look beyond traditional marketing to entire customer journey. Those in nonMarketing roles must adopt marketing practices and messaging.  Avg. breakeven point for most subscription software is 3.1 yrs.  Customers must trust in your company not just the solution. They must feel that youll stay around wont rip them off wont trap them. They must continue believing they made the right decision.  Before sale marketing must demonstrate value and earn trust. After sale marketing must nurture value and sustain trust.  You keep customers happy by doing exactly the same things that won them in the first place. You win customers by focusing on their needs. You keep them the same way.  Customer journey is better metaphor than funnel. Funnel metaphor treats sales process like inevitable linear path. It generally disregards what happens after 1st sale imperiling ongoing interactions with customer. It ignores feedback loops (nurturing customers so they renew upselling soliciting referrals) that are part of subscription biz.  Rather than focusing on number of leads generating focus on attracting prospects who will find success with your solution and remain loyal customers.  Marketings job is to increase EVC (economic value to customer) EVC must exceed cost of renewing.  A subscription replaces many small decisions to pay with one (the subscription). Cognitive science shows that customers are happiest when they pay up front and get the pain out of the way then are free to enjoy results of purchase.  ValueNurturing Strategies  After sale Marketings job is value nurturing.  Approaches to value nurturing  1. Help customers find functional or financial success (save money make life easier be entertained etc.).  2. Demonstrate value. Help customers realize theyre being successful through reminders or data.  3. Create value outside solution through content community data additional services.  4. Tend and nurture relationship. Make customers love doing biz with you. Confirm customers belief that subscription is good economic decision.  5. Align solution with customers values (principles ideals).  Provide instruction and training to increase tangible and intangible value.  Case studies are valuable to current customers as well as for attracting new ones. When a customer first subscribes send them relevant case studies. Actively solicit customers for interesting stories to create new case studies. Stories and quotes straight from the customer are most powerful.  Try to convert usage data into measurement of benefit (time saved blog posts published etc.). Not everyone reads reports so make data more obvious. Use yearend reports and gamification to make it fun. If you cant easily get data for each customer share aggregated data.  Dont offer to pay for referrals. Behavioral psychology shows that offering payment for referrals reduces motivation. It changes the transaction from personal to commercial and cheapens it. Instead personally express thanks and send an unanticipated gift after the referral. Instead of giving money consider giving special treatment access to events.  Putting the Strategies into Action  After sending a case study send followup content that gives instructions or answers questions.  Customer Success Management is an integration of Marketing Sales Professional Services Training and Support to meet the needs of recurring revenue companies.  If you have to change a pricing model or service present situation as a potential gain rather than a loss. For example if you raise prices try to add features.  Offer a reasonable number of tiersoptions but dont overwhelm. People want and expect choices to have a sense of control.  Inadequacy marketing is based on idea that prospects lack something that can only be fixed with a purchase. It encourages greed vanity insecurity. The hero of the story is product service or brand. By contrast empowerment marketing helps customers on their own paths to growth and maturity. Customer is hero and your product service or brand supports them. Example Apple ads show people doing wonderful things with Apple products. Empowerment marketing is much more effective in value nurturing.;Anne H. Janzer

You will learn practical ways to communicate messages of grace and truth how to discipline in a way that motivates your child and how to keep your relationship strong not antagonistic. Discipline is more than just a shortterm attempt to modify your childs actionsits a longterm investment to help them build faith wisdom and character for life. When you discover a better path to discipline youll find a more wellbehavedand wellbelievedkid.;240;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1501972822m35919981.jpg;Discipline that Connects with Your Childs Heart;nonfiction;This parenting book walks through four messages you must communicate to your child to connect with them when disciplining. Its quite thorough with plenty of specific examples. The authors say the book is all about leading children into a deeper connection with Gods holiness and love.  Although its a Christian parenting book and includes Bible references it seems like this book leans more on psychology and less on the Bible than other Christian parenting books. There were a few times that I questioned how the authors applied a verse.  From reading it and not yet putting it into practice I can only say that it seems the framework would be effective. My wife and I read this because we continue to struggle with disciplining our 4 and 2yearold kids.  Notes  Four Essential Messages  1. You are safe with me. Child must feel emotionally and physically safe. If you discipline from a need to control child will feel unsafe and learn to be intimidated by anger. Calm down and be thoughtful. Instead of trying to make problem go away immediately model Gods grace and truth.  2. You are loved no matter what. Tough discipline is rarely delivered with forgiveness and grace.  3. You are called and capable. Most misbehavior involves a skill find it beneath the sin. Redirect it for honoring purposes dont squash it. Focus on potential rather than failure.  4. You are responsible. Consequences shouldnt force kids to serve time but restitute and reconcile. Use constructive not punitive consequences.  Lessons Our Kids Truly Need  Come along child as a guide. Create a safe place for them to share real feelings. Be with them no longer seen as an opponent or authority figure. Keep your position of authority but put responsibility into childs hands and gain respect.  When you try to domineer (gain instant control in a situation) kids either comply to stay out of trouble or eventually rebel against control. Either way they never learn to be selfguided.  1. You Are Safe With Me  Examples of constructive consequence  Child who disrespectfully yells at sibling must share 4 encouraging and loving things with sibling.  Child who refuses to finish chores gets privileges back when chores are done and compensates others with extra chore.  Child who lied creates a plan to restore trust in relationship.  Forward Progress Begins With a Backward Step  Once kids perceive us to be safe theyre receptive to love and guidance.  Before disciplining breathe and pray to activate safety. This helps you be a gentle guide not a demanding bully.  Frightened kids tend to fight back or be intimidated into compliance. Either way they dont learn respect obedience wisdom.  Keeping My Kids Safe From My Baggage  Dont attack kids or theyll get defensive and think about your response rather than their behavior. Show that you have their best interests in mind. Help child consider what would be wiser behavior in future.  Help child learn to calm down by describing our feelings and strategy for calming down.  The intense attention you give when yelling at child rewards bad behavior.  Reply to whining with If I give you what you want when you whine that would teach you that whining is a good way to get what you want. Thats not true.  To keep interaction calm say Im feeling angry. Maybe youre angry too. What should we do to calm down Or Ive had a tough day and it seems youre having a tough time too. Or I want to be sure you feel loved even though Im going to talk to you about what you did.  Communicate with grace. Kids who hear Scripture used primarily to correct misbehavior may develop distaste for it. Speak about wisdom and joy of obedience. Show that conviction from Gods Word is helpful not shameful.  Proactively share a positive (do) that counteracts a negative (dont).  Becoming a Calmer Parent  Instead of fast large loud aim for slow low listen.  Slow buy time to deescalate. Ways step back walk slowly tell child youre going to another room to calm down speak slowly.  Low keep energy low and calm and posture nonintimidating. Ways sit beside child put hands behind back breathe deeply.  Listen. Give kids space to talk first. Ask gentle questions such as Whats happening here How can we solve it Remind yourself that you love child. Walk in childs shoes ask yourself What are they feeling What do they need Ask God for guidance.  When you lose temper ask child for a doover.  Renewing My Mind for Parenting  For your no to be respected you need a sound rationale. Sometimes you require immediate obedience without explanation and obedience is more likely if youve proved respectful and trustworthy.  You dont have a right to peace quiet obedience etc. Thinking so triggers your overreaction. You cant control how clean the house is but you can control your attitude when you enter it.  Getitright demands dont inspire growth. Compassion does.  2. You Are Loved No Matter What  Misbehavior Golden Opportunity for Unconditional Love  Biggest deposits in emotional bank account occur when kids misbehave. Thats when you convince child youll love them despite what they do.  How to judge your discipline  If a camera recorded you disciplining and childs peers watched video on mute what would they say its like to be child being disciplined  What messages do your facial expressions and body language send  Showing unconditional love doesnt reinforce negative behavior.  When child gets bad grades say Doing well in school is important. But whats more important is that I love you and your grades cant change that.  Parents should patiently gently correct (Gal 51).  Whining can be how child copes with anxiety. Ask Are you scared that ... Address underlying anxiety instead of tone. Say I can see youre really upset. Thats hard isnt it  Putting LoveNoMatterWhat Into Action  How to convey unconditional love  Put I love you into words.  Give gentle touch.  Demonstrate empathy.  Truly listen repeat what you hear.  Show love with face.  Ensure bodily expressions match your loving words.  3. You Are Called and Capable  Finding and Building Strengths Even in Misbehavior  Find and strengthen whats right instead of instantly punishing wrong.  Use questions and choices to guide kids to resolve disputes Do you want to solve this respectfully now or do you need to calm down first How much help do you need This tells them theyre capable instead of a problem.  Be like Jesus watchful prayerful dependent on God discerning whats really going on with child.  Be with child encouraging obedience not against them leveraging authority.  Heb 1210 tells us to discipline for childs good not for our relief or desire for control.  Discovering Diamonds in the Rough  Dont threaten child to clean up. Instead ask child to come by you while you pick up and take away toys as consequence for not cleaning up.  Respond to bad behavior with I appreciate your [skill] but how youre using that gift right now isnt helpful. This helps kids calm down because its encouraging rather than criticizing.  Building the Wisdom Kids Need  Options offered with intimidation or coercion usually feel like snares. Instead calm down briefly connect with child and offer 2 reasonable and desirable choices.  Obedience should be a natural decision flowing from love and trust not control.  ProblemSolving and SkillBuilding  Next time you want to say no to child teach them the yes and help them value the why (Eph 42829).  4. You Are Responsible for your Actions  The Goal of Biblical Discipline Restoring Hearts  Have child use gift that was behind misbehavior to make it right. This also helps child learn to use gift in positive ways.  Help child practice the right response (doover).  Reaping and Sowing Natural Impacts  Explain natural impacts without lecturing.  Ask questions to help kids discover natural impacts.  Teaching about natural impacts helps kids learn judgment conscience and internal motivation to correct poor choices.  Appendix Wisdom for Specific Challenges  Peaceful Daily Routines  3 goals of bedtime calm childs body calm childs spirit avoid rewarding attentiongetting and manipulation.  If child gets out of bed say I can help you get back in in a relaxed gentle way to avoid a power struggle.  Growing True Respect and Reconciliation  Whining  When kids whine dont whine back. Make a solid connection (instead of barking an order). State a clear consequence. Add a couple choices. Walk away if necessary to avoid a power struggle.  Tantrums  Peacefully dont respond to tantrums so child can selfcalm. Or use simple sentences to describe what you think they want so they feel understood.  Taking away object or privilege that sparked tantrum makes it worse. Give consequences with encouragement (Its really hard to turn off the iPad so it will take a break. When you turn off the TV quickly for a few days Ill know youre ready to try again with the iPad.).  Defiance  Deescalate defiance with active listening empathy rapport influence behavior change. The more understood the child feels the safer theyll feel to let go of defiance.  Use ifthen choices to empower kids for responsibility (If you put the toys away before dinner then you can have them tomorrow which would be really fun. Otherwise well put them away for you and you can have them again on Saturday and Im sure you can find other things to play with. You can choose either way.  Lying  Highly value truthtelling and treat lying with grace.  When you know child is tempted to lie set them up to tell truth. Instead of Did you brush teeth say Lets check your toothbrush. Do you think its wet or dry  Any time you hear truth say Youre telling the truth arent you Feels good doesnt it  Disrespect  When you angrily boss child around they learn anger equals power.  Calm first communicate second.  Stay respectful and lead with grace.  Sibling Conflict  Instead of entering family conflict yelling and punishing proclaim We are going to have a safe and loving home Say What youre doing right now is not safe and loving. Take a break until youre ready to resolve it that way.  Say This is really hard isnt it I remember fighting with my brother. Sit between kids with arm around each to convey acceptance and encouragement.  Peace Process  Build conflictresolving capability in kids.  1. Calm down. Reflect and regroup (not a timed punishment).  2. Understand each other. Help children identify and express feelings and listen to and understand each other.  3. Find good solution.  4. Celebrate success.  Support hurt child to confront offender to sincerely repent.;Jim Jackson Lynne Jackson
1235;36069721;3;50548;;A few days before Jesus gave his life on the cross his disciples asked What shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world (Matt. 243). Christ responded with the Olivet Discourse a detailed teaching on the doctrine of the last things.We need to understand the signs of Christs coming for our comfort as we look for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ (Titus 213).Christ had two concerns. First his disciples must know the signs of his coming which are footsteps of his approach. But Christ is not satisfied with mere signgazing which can lead to speculation and idle foolish living. He did not give signs to satisfy our curiosities but so that we will be ready for him when he returns. Therefore Christs second concern was the readiness of his disciples which is expressed in his urgent and repeated warnings to watch for his coming in light of the signs.Watch pray and serve the Lord with an eye to the signs of his return;286;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1503159718m36069721.jpg;Called to Watch for Christs Return;nonfiction;Explains the Reformed Amillennial view of eschatology (end times). Primarily draws from Jesus Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24 but also references other parts of Scripture. Part One walks through the signs of Christs coming and Part Two explains how to watch for Christs return (how to live until then).  The focus is on explaining Amillennialism not critiquing Postmillennialism or Premillennial Dispensationalism but it does that several times. The arguments against Postmillennialism arent always thorough or convincing. In the notes below I refer to Premillennial Dispensationalism as simply premil.  The book seems to put more weight on judgment (look what unbelievers have coming to them) than on grace (repent and believe and be saved).  Notes  The Approach to the Olivet Discourse  In Matthew 243 disciples asked both When shall these things be and What shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world Postmil preterist addresses first part but not second. Premil dispensationalist futurist view addresses second but not first. Amil typological view addresses both.  There are two threads in Matthew 2425 (destruction of Jerusalem end of world) and theyre so interwoven we cant completely unravel.  The Disciples Questions About the End  Premil says Mt 24 is about distant future but that would mean Jesus didnt answer disciples questions. Mt 24 says these things and these buildings not other ones in future.  Arguments against postmilpreterism   Christs coming will be visible to entire world (Matthew 2427). It will be preceded by wickedness and unbelief (v 37) not spiritual prosperity.   End of age or world is end of creationhistory not end of Jewish age same phrase as Matthew 133840 281920.   Christ warned that after destruction of temple the end was not yet.  Matthew 2434 means everything will happen as a type of the end of the world in the destruction of Jerusalem. Nevertheless that will not exhaust its fulfillment. ... They will continue right up to the coming of the Son of man. This is also Calvins interpretation of the Olivet Discourse there is no part of it which the present generation will not experience.  Deceivers Coming in Christs Name  Postmils push deceivers of Matthew 24 to before 70 AD so they dont interfere with golden age but 2 Timothy 313 warns that deceivers will grow worse.  Turmoil in Nature and Among the Nations  Precursory signs of Matthew 2468 (war famine pestilence earthquakes) mean that the end is not yet theyre just the beginning of sorrows. When these signs cease the end is near.  Postmil says the birth pains (sorrows) of Matthew 248 are end of Jewish age giving birth to Christian age. But birth pains occur before and after 70 AD (Romans 822).  The Church Hated by All Nations  Persecution wont cease for a Postmil Golden Age. Tense of Matthew 249 is ongoing.  The Cooling of the Love of Many  Postmil says apostasy of Matthew 2412 is apostasy of Jews before 70 AD. But apostasy must come before Christs Second Coming (2 Thessalonians 2).  Apostasy in last days also prophesied in 2 Timothy 315.  The Gospel Preached in All the World  Verses that speak of all nations worshiping Jehovah and which mention Jerusalem arent literalistic (Psalm 72911 Isaiah 223 Micah 412 Zechariah 1416 Malachi 111). They refer to New Testament (age of Messiah). Acts 151418 interprets Amos 9 as prophecy concerning Gentiles.  The Abomination of Desolation  Premil says weeks in Daniel 9 are years but thats not how week is ever used in Scripture. They put a gap between 69th and 70th weeksyears but thats not in Scripture. Secret rapture isnt in Scripture. Jews rebuilding temple isnt in Scripture.  Prophecies of abomination of desolation in Daniel 9 have three fulfillments Antiochus Epiphanes (167 BC) Roman general Titus leading up to 70 AD final Antichrist just prior to Christs second coming.  There must be a future abomination of desolation because Matthew 242931 says Christs Second Coming will occur immediately after tribulation triggered by abomination and that didnt happen in 70 AD.  Temple of God is true church (1 Peter 2410 1 Corinthians 31617 2 Corinthians 616 Ephesians 21922).  Millennium of Revelation 20 is a long indeterminate period of time between first and second coming of Christ (AKA New Testament age or last days). Satan is bound so all nations cant unite against church but church is still persecuted. Meanwhile souls of dead elect reign in heaven with Christ.  Abomination of desolation is image that Antichrist makes (Revelation 13).  The Great Tribulation  Revelation 13 teaches a world government ruled by one man (Antichrist) who will unleash the greatest tribulation (Revelation 137 15). This government will be political (Revelation 137) and religious (Revelation 133).  Great Tribulation will have extend greater than 70 AD which was a local war (Matthew 2421).  1 Thessalonians 41518 doesnt teach secret rapture. It teaches that Christ comes personally loudly with archangel and trumpet blast. 1 Thessalonians 5 which follows 1 Thessalonians 4 shows Christians arent raptured before end.  Revelation says church will be present during Antichrist and tribulation.  False Reports of Christs Coming  After apostolic age true church doesnt perform miracles (2 Corinthians 1212 Hebrews 24). In Acts miracles are only performed by apostles Steven and Philip who were commissioned by apostles and Ananias who was appointed by Jesus.  False religion and Antichrist can perform lying signs and wonders (2 Thessalonians 29 Revelation 131314).  Christs Glorious Coming  In Matthew 24 Christ never hints that Christians will be raptured before end.  Astronomical events (Luke 212526 Matthew 2429 Revelation 812 6814) are literal. These didnt happen in 70 AD. Old Testament prophecies containing astronomical signs (Isaiah 13910 3445 Ezekiel 3237) are types of final judgment. They prefigure destruction of world not 70 80. We interpret Old Testament in light of New Testament not vice versa.  Matthew 133843 speak of heavenly angels not preachers (messengers) as postmil claims. Otherwise Matthew 2431 would mean preachers are sent after worldwide spread of gospel which is wrong order (Matthew 2414).  The Parable of the Budding Fig Tree  Premil says Israel blossomed in 1948 but that would put it before its future destruction which isnt order of Matthew 24.  This generation in Matthew 2434 refers to people alive when Christ spoke those words. This is meaning of generation in Matthew (Matthew 117 1116 1241 2436). Generation never means Jewish race.  Bible doesnt teach spiritual rebirth of Israel. Christ cursed fig tree (Israel) forever in Matthew 21.  The Unknown Time of Christs Return  Luke 173436 (one shall be taken and the other left) refers to day of Christs second coming.  Christs Coming as in the Days of Noah  Days leading up to Second Coming will be very wicked as were days leading up to Flood. (Luke 172629 Matthew 243741).  In Matthew 2439 the one taking is an unbeliever taken in judgment and the one left behind is a believer. Matthew 24 says this will all take place at his coming not secretly before.  Watching as Faithful Talent Users  Talents in parable are opportunities occasions or positions in the kingdom or spheres of labor and service. They arent abilities because Matt 2515 speaks of ability separately.  The Final Judgment of the Sheep and Goats  Believers will be judged but acquitted not condemned. Mt 253146 John 52429 Rev 201113.  Bible speaks of 2 hells hell of Hades (OT Sheol) punishes souls only hell of lake of fire (Rev 1920 2010 1415) punishes soul and body.;Martyn McGeown

1264;471172;5;298786;1883591015;A simple and comprehensive introduction to Islam.My purpose in writing this book has been to provide all those persons Muslims nonMuslimswho have no access to the original sources of Islam with a brief treatise giving a lucid comprehensive and allembracing view of Islam.That is why I have avoided discussion over the minute details and have endeavoured to portray the entire picture of Islam in one perspective. Moreover I have not confined myself to stating what we Muslims believe in and stand for but have also tried to explain the rational bases of our beliefs. Similarly I have not only presented the Islamic modes of worship and the outlines of the Islamic way of life but have also tried to unveil the wisdom behind them. I hope this small treatise will go a long way to satisfy the intellectual cravings of the Muslim youth and will help the nonMuslims in understanding our real position. (from the foreword by Mawdudi)Ours is an age of anxiety and restlessness. A change is imperceptibly overtaking the world. The old order is disintegrating the new one is however yet to come. And history tells us that such ages of restlessness have also been periods of birth for new movements and cultures. The world is in the grip of a tension and awaits a twentiethcentury renaissance of man.A significant feature of the present century is the new and widespread trend of Islam revival. After a long period of stagnation the world of Islam is rising from its stupor. A new awakening has appeared on the horizon a new life is being infused into the community of Islam. This trend is visible in every country and at every place and has within it the possibilities of its becoming the harbinger of a new age (from the Editor Preface)About the AuthorMawlana Mawdudi occupies a pivotal position in the movement for Islamic rebirth in the 20th century. He started his revolutionary mission at a time when the Western civilization was at the height of its intellectual and political power and when almost the entire Muslim world was in the grip of the western colonial rule. The demise of the Ottoman Caliphate had extinguished the last apparent hope of the Muslim Ummah. The clouds of gloom were cast upon the Muslim world. The horizon looked dark and dismal. It was in this background that a young scholar Mawdudi raised a clarion call for Islamic revival and reassertion. He invited the Muslims to the real source of their strength  The Quran and Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad P.B.U.H. He awakened the Muslims to a new goal and mission to live and to die for Islam;0;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Towards Understanding Islam;nonfiction;Versi terjemahannya di Indonesia  DasarDasar Islam.

However instead of trying to understand the Brotherhood and criticizing it objectively critics have been unduly hostile to the organization.This book contains a true exposition of Masonry as a school of thought. The most important unifying influence among Masons is their philosophywhich can be best described according to such terms as materialism and secular humanism. But it is an errant philosophy based on false suppositions and flawed theories as you will see in this book.In this book the reader will also be presented with a summary of the history of the Masons struggle against theistic religions. Freemasons have played an important role in distancing Europe from religious moral values and in their place founding of a new order based on the philosophies of materialism and secular humanism. The reader will also see how Masonry has been influential in the imposition of these dogmasand a social order based on themon nonWestern civilizations.After reading this book the reader will be able to consider many aspects from schools of philosophy to newspaper headlines rock songs to political ideologies with a deeper understanding and better discern the meaning and aims behind events and factors.;228;httpss.grassets.comassetsnophotobook111x148bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png;Global FreeMasonry;nonfiction;Membaca versi ebooknya Adnan Oktar mengkaji sejarah freemasonry dengan cukup lengkap.;Harun Yahya

Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult secondhand description he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but almost hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel childrens voices adult voices underground voicesbut Holdens voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular yet remaining marvelously faithful to it he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders he keeps most of the pain to and for himself. The pleasure he gives away or sets aside with all his heart.

I was somewhat wrong.  I dont like quitting on books and thats how this book got 2 stars. 30 in I was thinking what a piece of junk. 80 of the book can be summarized as follow teenager thinks everyone is a moron and a phony thinks hes so cool because he smokes and keeps sweating. he hates and has no respect for everyone for no good reason other than his self righteousness. and guess what hes a moron and a phony too. (got ripped off by a prostitute assumed a caring teacher to be gay for him tried to impress a guy by drinking a lot and interrogating the guy about his sex life...)  the last 20 saves it from a 0 star book to a 2 star book. because at least he loves his baby sister and thats about all the good things I can say about him. and it is somewhat a good turning point of the book where he decided hell stay for his sister. (its not like he can go anywhere anyway.)  I cannot tell how many times I was like this is what emo teenage boy who craves attention in this world writes Im done reading about this guys complain about every single thing in the world. it is damn right depressing.  maybe this is the coming of age type of story that some teenage boys resonate with but if this excessive whining really ruins the whole book.;J.D.

But hidden within the rituals of its creation is a fascinating and mysterious storya story of two remarkable men whose strange twentyyear relationship lies at the core of this historic undertaking.Professor James Murray an astonishingly learned former schoolmaster and bank clerk was the distinguished editor of the OED project. Dr. William Chester Minor an American surgeon from New Haven Connecticut who had served in the Civil War was one of the thousands of contributors who submitted illustrative quotations of words to be used in the dictionary. But Minor was no ordinary contributor. He was remarkably prolific sending thousands of neat handwritten quotations from his home in the small village of Crowthorne fifty miles from Oxford. On numerous occasions Murray invited Minor to visit Oxford and celebrate his work but Murrays offer was regularlyand mysteriouslyrefused.Thus the two men for two decades maintained a close relationship only through correspondence. Finally in 1896 after Minor had sent nearly ten thousand definitions to the dictionary but had still never traveled from his home a puzzled Murray set out to visit him.

Gorey tells the tale of 26 children (each representing a letter of the alphabet) and their untimely deaths in rhyming dactylic couplets accompanied by the authors distinctive black and white illustrations. It is one of Edward Goreys bestknown books and is the most notorious amongst his roughly halfdozen mock alphabets.[2] It has been described as a sarcastic rebellion against a view of childhood that is sunny idyllic and instructive. The morbid humor of the book comes in part from the mundane ways in which children die such as falling down the stairs or choking on a peach. Far from illustrating the dramatic and fantastical childhood nightmares these scenarios instead poke fun at the banal paranoias that come as a part of parenting.;32;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1327933644m47558.jpg;The Gashlycrumb Tinies (The Vinegar Works 1);comics graphic;Its rather dark for a kid to learn his ABC isnt it....

I love it.  Mr. Popper was a painter but he was always fascinated by Arctic and Antarctic expeditions taken by Admiral Drake. He watched all his documentaries and listened to his shows on the radio and he often wrote letters to Admiral Drake too. One day he heard Admiral Drake addressing him on the radio and said that he has a surprise for him The next day he got a penguin from Antarctica This is the story of what happens after.  I like where this story sits itself on a lot of stuff that happened in it makes sense like drilling holes on the refrigerator door so that the penguin sleeping inside can have fresh air. It makes complete sense sort of. But its also perfectly imaginary because Im sure an aquarium will not just give out a penguin for nothing. I love that its fiction based on an impossible scenario but that the events are not crazily scifi. Its believable which makes it the perfect children book;Richard Atwater Florence Atwater Robert Lawson

Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research Ariely explains how expectations emotions social norms and other invisible seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.Not only do we make astonishingly simple mistakes every day but we make the same types of mistakes Ariely discovers. We consistently overpay underestimate and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want and we overvalue what we already own.

I was right. I thought racing in the rain literally means the dog running in the rain as we all know some dogs love to do. I couldnt have been more wrong.  Enzo was born a racer. Even though hes a dog and he didnt know it when hes born he was born to be a racer. Raised by a human aspiring race car driver Denny he was stuck on the passenger seat witnessing Dennys life as it goes by. But he wasnt just a spectator he eventually grows up and sees that he has a life mission he is to help steer Denny onto the right path. Its not like Denny was weak but when faced with immense obstacle in life we all have our breaking points luckily Enzo was there to listen to protect and to nudge.  The novel was deeply emotional more so for any dog owners out there. I read this as I gently stroke my dogs soft fur and I wonder if she ever sees the world this way. Well I dont mean literally like Enzo because Im sure Lyra is not human at heart but I wonder if she also listens to me sees my trembling hands and try her best to nudge me onto the right path too.  The books racing references are great even though Im only familiar with little like the story of Senna. At times the detailed description of car handling had me somewhat lost I was wowed by how Mr. Stein has carefully illustrated what happened when you drive a car on a wet track or what you do when you spin out. I dont know about his background but Mr. Stein obviously knows A WHOLE LOT about racing. It also makes the book more approachable for male audiences. Not all doggie books are only touchy feely.  As my dog now kept nudging me to go to bed Id end with the car goes where the eyes go. And your eyes should be reading this book at some point in time.;Garth Stein

Some of the symptoms are so spot on that I wonder if this is the solution to my problem that Ive been looking for for such a long time.  The book is written by an MD and the claims are quite wellsubstantiated in my opinion. As a scientist who had taken classes in biology most of what was discussed in the book makes scientific sense and aligns with what I know. I love that the book attempts to establish the background of the clean program before presenting the program to the reader. Even though Ive been dying to flip directly to the chapter of the Clean program (chap.7) I actually read through the previous chapters to learn about the basis of the program which puts the clean program on a good footing.  I havent yet tried out the clean program but I really look forward to it  The only reason I took off 1 star is that even though the author tries really hard to present this clean program as the holy grail of cleanse and health program.. It added in a lot of gimmick words that are crucial to the other cleanse programs it tries to replace. (like the word quantum....) And the multiple insertions of the premade clean program available for purchase on the companys website is also quite annoying at times. I felt like this is the main destruction of the whole program because as it boasts an all natural diet using ingredients grown in nature yet the reader can also buy the processed powder that contains all the nutrients we need to do this cleanse. On one side were told to buy food that nature provides on the other side you can get the same effects from this powder that is manmade. Thats peculiarly ironic and is my biggest complain against the book.  I am still going to try out the clean program (not the powder part obviously) and see if this change in food I consume will get reboot my health. And I recommend everyone reading this book but as always read it with a grain of salt.;Alejandro Junger

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking reading to partying who innovate and create but dislike selfpromotion who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled quiet it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to societyfrom van Goghs sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.Passionately argued impressively researched and filled with indelible stories of real people Quiet shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts and how much we lose in doing so.

She talks to AsianAmerican students who feel alienated from the brash backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cuttingedge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.Perhaps most inspiring she introduces us to successful introvertsfrom a witty highoctane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks to a recordbreaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions.

Obviously the answer is Bill but sometimes its not so clear. Theres a lot of backstories on each of the character in BioShock which any BioShock fan will appreciate.. But as a standalone book its a bit lacking a lot of characters arent wrapped up at the end of the book obviously because they will show up in the game.. Hence the book is only so good as a novel aimed at fans of BioShock.

And Id like to thank Horowitz for doing a great job in resurrecting Watson. the story was great the mystery was quite wonderful. only complaint is the Watson by Doyle never quite chitchat as much and writing was more rigid and factual. printing was probably more expensive then and modern books need a certain thickness to look good on a book stand and justify the price. looking forward to reading the next book in the series.;Anthony Horowitz

Hence why I picked up this book.. (It was also on sale that helps.)  Id say this book started really awful. If Im a person whod put down a book when its bad I wouldnt have finished this book. Luckily I am persistent in finishing what I started reading so I was able to reach a point where the book got wayyyy better To talk about why I think its bad we have to talk about the format of the book.  We all know that Jane Austen being a powerhouse her style of writing is quite hard to master unless you extensively studied her work and probably wrote a thesis on her. Its good that the author tried to set herself apart from Austens style of narration. It takes courage to know your limits and acknowledge it. Instead she used the diary style for a more casual tone and avoid the serious formalism in the original work. But being a diary it is really important to sound like an 18yearold writing her diary. And here are some of the things I really dont agree with. There is no sane person who write in a diary how they look like in case [future generation who reads this diary needs to know how I look like]. It sounds super unnatural and redundant and the worst part is anyone reading this book probably read PP so there really is no need to describe how she looks like. If shes trying to make the book selfcontained for other readers there really is no need. Next. There are wayyy too many mentions of the SAME EXACT INFORMATION e.g. Darcy is 10 years Georgianas senior shes 19 years old her mom died when she was 6.. etc. Seriously who on earth will mentioned her mom dying when she was 6 over and over again especially in the earlier chapters. Each character is also introduced multiple times.. and I was like.. I ALREADY KNOW WHO MR. DARCY IS. As a wellwritten and published fan fiction its important to know who your target audience is and avoid annoying them really. Lastly its really really easy to spot how Austen replaced all please with pray. I wish that was used here too.  Aside from that the story really did get better once the initial annoyances are done away with. The story is well constructed with a similar plot twist as that of PP. Even though I kind of dont agree that Georgiana once almost eloped with Wickham because shes too shy to reject him I am ok with the authors own perspective on this and it is needed to convince the reader Georgianas fixation on her true love. In my opinion though it actually makes the love less convincing though because if she really loved someone since she was 6 she would have had mustered enough courage to not be swoon over by Wickham. I really quite like her treatment of other characters though they all have enough Austenesque story and personality that makes the story quite enjoyable once you ignored all the above mentioned flaws.  Nice light read recommended if youre a PP fan and just couldnt get enough..;Anna Elliott

(Is that Victorianera I actually dont know..) By any means this is not your classic upright romance pretty sexual and fiery in certain scenes when its called for.. However I thought the era and customs of that time is pretty wellresearched and the characters were all wellwritten and thoughtout. The romance is definitely there I particularly like how the author designed that Ferguson and Madeleines love is not just some fantasy love in a perfect world.. They are actually in love and its wonderful to see that both characters stood up and overcame their personal baggages for the love. The passion is very convincing..;Sara Ramsey

The seriously cheerful and positive and affirming tone has fallen rather deaf on a cynical 20 something year old in this day and age of constant disappointment and angry youth. Anyway I love selfhelp books and I have read many so I would say I can tell when one is helpful and when one is simply bs. As much as I find it annoying that many of the ideas kept repeating itself over and over in the book and the cheery tone I have to admit that the author does know what hes talking about. Many of the ideas he introduced in the book have been introduced by many people over and over again but the author has done a really fantastic job of laying it out and explaining why each idea is crucial and important. I really am rather convinced by his entire narrative on how Miracle Mornings can change lives and I cant wait to try it out.  Conclusion tone is wayyyyyy to cheery and you can do it for my liking and sometimes the content is stretched way too long just so the substance is more substantial. But the premise of the book is sound and I find the explanation thorough and sufficient.;Hal Elrod

But when one evening at twilight a lone black wolf ambled into view not far from his doorstep Nick would finally come to know this mystical speciesup close as never before.A Wolf Called Romeois the remarkable story of a wolf who returned again and again to interact with the people and dogs of Juneau living on the edges of their community engaging in an improbable aweinspiring interspecies dance and bringing the wild into sharp focus. At first the people of Juneau were guarded torn between shoot first ask questions laterinstincts and curiosity. But as Romeo began to tag along with crosscountry skiers on their daily jaunts play fetch with local dogs or simply lie near Nick and nap under the sun they came to accept Romeo and he them. For Nick it was about trying to understand Romeo then it was about winning his trust and ultimately it was about watching over him for as long as he or anyone could.Written with a deft hand and a searching heart A Wolf Called Romeois an unforgettable tale of a creature who defied nature and thus gave humans a chance to understand it a little more.;288;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1377648650m18222689.jpg;A Wolf Called Romeo;nonfiction;I dont think Ive ever felt as sad as I do now nor shed tears from a book. But I shed tears for the story of Romeo. His life was nothing short of a miracle.  When I first saw this book at an airport bookstore I was entranced by its cover. A wolf with a dog Surely Ive heard enough of wolfs bad rep in my life. I have a husky and have countless times been told that my dog is as violent and uncontrollable as a wolf because they look alike. (What a bunch of uninformed people. Huskies are just as close to wolf genetically as a pug. My husky is definitely more wellmannered than the next doors small dog.) And as author Nick Jans mentioned in his book wolves are vilified often in our culture think red riding hood and the wolves in Lord of the Rings. But in my heart wolves have such a special place. Other than the fact that my husky resembles one they are also proud elegant and majestic creatures. Nevertheless I looked at the book and was interested in reading it thinking itd be more of a personal story with Romeo like Until Tuesday. (Which was also a great book.) Though I didnt buy it right then simply because airport books are often wayyy overpriced.  Eventually I did get it because when I looked for books to read the first on the list is always A Wolf Called Romeo even though I still had unread books on my shelf. If you havent decided to read this book yet at least look up Romeos photo that should do some convincing.  The book has an over arching story of Romeos life starting from when he first appeared in Juneau and meeting Nick till his untimely murder after 6 years. In between the narrative of Romeos appearance and encounters along the years Nick has interlaced the story with related snippets about wolves. The transitions are very smooth and wellconnected. Nicks huntingjournalist background was described political views and arguments on wolf population control were nearly presented and argued and a thorough introduction to everything (biological anthropological and cultural) about wolves was laid out.  Ill admit part of the political stuff was slightly boring and sometimes the detailed correspondences between the state officials and the public are less than exciting. But this isnt a fairy tale or a made up story. Life often contains mundane stuff that we all have to go through and Romeos life isnt short of any bureaucracy and politics among humans. If anything these boring parts paint a complete picture on Romeos life than a magical story of I met a wolf it was magical and then he was shot now Im devastated. It also serves to show how little a wolfs life is in his hands and what twisted policies we have on the lives of something we should respect and have no right to kill. I would additionally like to applaud Nicks ability to stay detached and objective on a lot of political issues described in the book. Even though his opinion is noted mildly he still presents both sides of argument and allows the reader to form his own judgment.  I also love the photos at the end of each chapter that I emailed Nick asking if I could purchase a print. The photos made Romeo so approachable like maybe after reading his story I knew him too.  If you think wolves are awesome and just want to read a book about I met a wolf and hes my best friend and this is our love story then this might not be the book youre looking for. But that doesnt mean you shouldnt still pick up a copy and read it. Because behind all the sadness and pain and angry as long as you read the book Romeo will live on in our hearts and maybe one day someone might change his mind about wolves because of this book and another wolf can be saved.;Nick Jans

Theyre adorable and I have alpaca scarves and carpets they are amazing. Naturally Id love to live vicariously through this book to experience the life of raising alpaca.. I love books about people moving abroad to do something brave and unconventional. The best ones are either heartfelt funny or moving and I have read books in all three categories. But this one just fell really really flat without any of those essence.  The tone of the book is quite unemotional. I have not heard a more uninteresting party where whatever the patrons were doing was described in text but theres no passion no awe no nothing. And with the cria dying its the same I can obviously imagine it being a very painful experience probably heart breaking to see a life goes.. But again the narration just felt very.. ok shes not breathing she took her last breath my wife is crying.If you ever read any of James Herriot book youd know after 60 stories in his 2 books he still managed to make your heart ache over an animal dying.  The background and development of characters is.. simply not there. Theres minimal background on the characters. Wife Lorna was a dance teacher had health problems and wanted a change. Good. Alan is... I have no clue about anything about the author what did he do Why was he so motivated in the move Nothing. The absolutely worst is the kids. What kind of 19 year old in UK can just ditch school move to Spain and just work on the farm What happened to school Or work Does she not have any aspirations To make things worse the author only refers to her as Lornas daughter which at the end of the book makes me wonder if Frankie and Mark (the kids) arent the children of Alan (the author). No sensible father will ever call his children my wifes children through the entire book. Also whenever Frankie flew back to UK its always mom being emotional because daughter is leaving theres absolutely ZERO mention of the authors feeling.. If you married a woman for at least 10 years youd have some feelings for her kids too The style of writing made me feel like the author has zero emotions towards the kids leaving which is super odd and unnatural. And even weirder Frankies epileptic boyfriend can ALSO just drop out of his entire life (and healthcare) in UK and move to Spain with them. They arent married theyre 19. That is just simply unrealistic. What kind of teenage boy will just skip schoolwork and move to Spain with a girlfriend Doesnt his parents have a say too  Additionally theres simply not enough stories about alpacas. I got the book because I wanna hear stories about alpacas. Theres just a general lacking of information on these wonderful animals they centered their lives around. This book is more about we rooted our lives to move to Spain than about raising alpacas.. I am disappointed.;Alan Parks

The lie says that to live is to be comfortable. To live is to be free of struggle. The lie says that the ultimate existence would be to never want for anything to never be pushed so far that it hurts. So why do some of us seek out edge experiences Why do we flirt with deprivation with intentional chaos Why do some of us push toward and through our own physical emotional and emotional limits just to see how it feelsEvery day safe in our modern cocoons we can comfortably ignore the fact we are dying.

I am not a big fan of short stories because I always think that there wont be enough after the story ends Ill be left wondering what happened to the characters.. But I gave this book a try and I am glad I did. Grad school has been brainfrying and somehow I found myself giving myself excuses to read more than one short story at a time between assignments. The stories also flow very smoothly so its quite engaging once I started.  The stories are all very well thought out the circumstances are a little bit odd but that is what perked my interest as I read. The absolute favorite thing I love about this book is that a small part of the main characters life is displayed in plain sight emotions raw and motionless then as other characters are introduced those emotions brew but never boil over. Yet from their reactions I know theyve been transformed. The hindsight is also carefully planted through the stories to show how the character eventually turned out. The emotions resonate as I read the book and put myself in the characters shoes. The description of humanity and irony of life is carefully crafted into the stories our existences just the sum of our faults we are all vulnerable to weaknesses and temptations..  The only complaint I have is the authors need to declare every characters full name even if theyre not important. I really dont need to know the boys 3 best friends full name if they arent really important to the story.. Its somewhat unnatural when 7yo refers to their friends in their complete names no Plus the characters introduction is somewhat in my face in my opinion. A lot of name throwing in a very short amount of words.;Jacob M. Appel

Im not a frequent romance reader and this year Ive been focused on reading books that shows up on mustread list so buying this set wasnt really in my plan. However after reading Pride and Prejudice and reading a couple of serious works that are not happy to say the least I wanted to read something light and happy. And well Christmas is coming up so I went to Amazon to see whats in store and found this set.  This set has some good stories and some averagemeh stories. But theyre all stories you can tell right off the bat theyll end up with the perfect guy. It sometimes annoys me that the character always felt physically attracted to each other even when theyre supposed to hate each other. (e.g. my ex broke my heart. Im still sad. OMG his body oh I shouldnt. But I felt this weird attraction like Ive never felt.) I get that theyre holiday stories and are supposed to be magical just dont think its normal to check a guy out when you hate them.  I also think the quality of the stories was high in the beginning low in the middle and got better again in the last few stories.  Theres one big thing I want to point out though. I know these are not serious literature work and most of these novellas are not published individually. That doesnt mean you dont proof read your work. I found numerous mistake ranging from spelling mistakes and typos to the mix up of characters name. Some novellas have none some have quite a lot. And sometimes characters are mentioned who arent introduced before leaving me super confused as to who these people are  But for 0.99 you can overlook these problems and just enjoy some warm Christmas romance;Donna Fasano Ginny Baird Helen Scott Taylor Beate Boeker Melinda Curtis Raine English Aileen Fish Patricia Forsythe Grace Greene Mona Risk Roxanne Rustand Magdalena Scott Kristin Wallace Denise Annette Devine

I am not usually a big scifi supernatural fiction fan yes I read twilight in my early teens but thats about it. Usually when I received the monthly Amazon First email I dont pick one genre I look at descriptions of all 4 books and pick one that seems the most interesting. For this month the romance looks a bit lacking the other book sounds too sad and serious and the description of Boundary Crossed seems pretty inviting so I got it.  I finished this book in 6 hours.  I love the premise of the story exarmy in her 30s starting out fresh in her hometown suddenly drawn into the world of supernaturals in order to protect the daughter of her dead twin sister. We get to learn about the Old World as Lex learns about it the author carefully plants characters that slowly reveals things to her without cramming up the book with too much information in a page. The plot twists are all very solid and not oddmakes no sense even though some are predictable (the saving Simon part). Every single character in this book is very welldesigned their characters are consistent through the whole book with enough back stories for each. I love that Quinn and Lex didnt have that omgloveatfirstsightletsmetearyourclothesoff kind of chemistry keeping the romance light and the love between auntandniece strong is wellsuited for the tone of the book. Obviously Quinn has some past (regarding the wife) that was not explained and I hope to read about that in the next book.. The sisters murder mystery was apparent when the cop investigating her murder is off the grid I thought that would be relevant in this book but apparently not again something to look forward to in the next book.

As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory.Here she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools cadets struggling through their first days at West Point and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee.

Part memoir part historical and social analysis J. D. Vances Hillbilly Elegyis a fascinating consideration of class culture and the American dream.Vances grandparents were dirt poor and in love. They got married and moved north from Kentucky to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. Their grandchild (the author) graduated from Yale Law School a conventional marker of their success in achieving upward mobility for their family. But Vance cautions that is only the short version. The slightly longer version is that his grandparents aunt uncle and mother struggled to varying degrees with the demands of their new middle class life and they and Vance himself still carry around the demons of their chaotic family history.Delving into his own personal story and drawing on a wide array of sociological studies Vance takes us deep into working class life in the Appalachian region. This demographic of our country has been slowly disintegrating over forty years and Vance provides a searching and cleareyed attempt to understand when and how hillbillies lost faith in any hope of upward mobility and in opportunities to come.At times funny disturbing and deeply moving this is a family history that is also a troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large portion of this country.;272;httpsimages.grassets.combooks1463569814m27161156.jpg;Hillbilly Elegy A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis;nonfiction;A very moving account of his life up till now.

Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents indiscretion Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could at any moment steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africas tyrannical white rule Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centurieslong struggle.Born a Crimeis the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist.

And sometimes Id get celebritys books because they are funny and also fun to read. Other than personal stories and anecdotes I never am really none the wiser after reading them. Kinda like watching a funny rom com. But this is not that.  I only learned of Trevor Noah when he took the reign over from Jon Stewart. There was a moment in time I was like this is the worst thing ever Jon Stewart is the best But Trevor Noah has been doing a good job and has earned my viewership so far. So when his book came out I was like hmm this might be interesting like Tina Feys or Amy Schumers book which both were very enjoyable. Talking mostly about their personal story and how they got to where they are.. But this is not that.  This is about South Africa about apartheid about women in Africa. I never thought Id learned so much about African history from a book by a comedian. Yes he wrote largely about his childhood and his early adult life. But his was also the life of a colored child navigating the complexities of school and family at the time of apartheid. The book was insightful in a way that it shows what life was during and right after apartheid how white color and black people were segregated through time the relationship morphing as apartheid ended. And it was moving. By writing his own story I got a rare glimpse of who Trevor Noah really is and respect him so much more because of it. And I cannot end the review by saying how awesome his mother is. She is a jewel of this book and of this world.;Trevor Noah
